Its essentially been treated as a safe haven.\n\nHistorically Safe havens don't last very long and  institutions are more of a mix between profit maximisers and hodlers of various assets.\n\nIn the 70s gold and silver saw impressive rallies due to runaway inflation. These rallies were fueled mostly by institutions and big players. However the prices of assets crashed soon after.\n\nSince the USA government managed to get a hold of things by raising intrest rates to 20%. \n\n2011 saw another impressive gold and silver rally due to  US hesitation to raise the debt ceiling. Usually raising the debt ceiling happens automatically and quickly. There was a real possibility that the USA wouldn't be able to pay its debts.\n\nOnce the US raised the debt ceiling safe havens such as Gold and Silver tanked.\n\nWho remembers ww3? When Trump assassinated Soleimani?\n\nPanic ensued and people thought a USA-Iran war would lead to a world war though other global powers siding with Iran.\n\nDuring this this time Bitcoin had a impressive rally, however cooler heads managed to prevail and the crisis was averted.\n\nWould have bitcoin continued rise without covid 19? unlikely due to assets such as oil dropped after ww3 was averted.\n\nFinally we have Covid 19 where bitcoin crashed with the rest of the financial markets. The crash was so great there weren't any buy orders on exchange order books.\n\nIronically Bitcoin and other financial markets were saved by the federal reserve. The very thing the crypto community despises. If they didn't print money this rally would be impossible.\n\nI can confidently say we would see a multi year bear market in every financial asset, if money wasn't printed.\n\nIf Bitcoin was a safe haven why did it tank?\n\nMoving forward today, the global governments are in crisis, however I doubt it will last long because we have had major crisises before and things have recovered just fine.\n\nIf bitcoin is a safe haven, I think it will tank if and when things go back to normal. Just like any other safe haven in history.\n\nAnyhow everyone in the crypto community should be thanking and kissing the feet of the federal reserve.
