But this doesn\u2019t come without risk. The higher the APY (annual percentage yield) for these farming and staking pools, the higher the risk exposure the holder faces.\n\nWith this risk vs. benefit problem being largely ignored, a new project called ***Yearn Machine Learning*** (***YML***) has taken on the job of protecting yield farmers by using specific parameters and multi-agent enforcement learning. The developers of ***YML*** are using *historical data and algorithms to help create models that have the capabilities to predict which yield pools have the most optimization*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s5eu49o8hz961.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0cee7d73aad27dce97f1ec1e997f9c0f7c7dd7e\n\n***Yearn Machine Learning*** (***YML***, *Contract Address: 0xD7E48d68DCE805C97bB66B2AfFaDcdFcd47E1F95*) is an ERC20 token bringing yield farmers a new way to earn the most APY. The project is utilizing its own algorithms built by the developers that will help point holders in the right direction, meaning providing data and a solution using said data to receive the highest APY via the most efficient pools available. The developers call this process of using machine learning \u201cMulti-agent Reinforcement Learning\". One of the algorithms used to process the data needed to weigh risk vs. benefit is the ***Deterministic Policy Gradient*** (*DDPG*).\n\nThis algorithm simultaneously learns a *Q-Function* and the policy in question, in this instance the code surrounding yield farming protocols, in order for the *Q-Function* to analyze the policy in question.\n\nThese Deep Learning Reinforcement calculations create a form of artificial intelligence that can help predict which pools will provide the highest return percentage for yield farmers. The AI developed by the team at ***YML*** utilizes multiple agents that perceive the yield opportunities with sensors written in the code and acts on these opportunities with effectors. YML\u2019s code, written in C++, has recently been audited by *Solidity.Finance.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ex7rv4l9hz961.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=acbd897788f3d83b6e8f3bff8ba1dfee0527210c\n\nAll of the things ***YML*** does in the background is compacted and presented to the user in a polished dashboard which displays your ROI (*return on investment rates will be subject to change as this rate is not a permanent one as a result of the agents finding the most profitable farming pools with the least amount of risk*) along with other vital data so yield farmers can monitor their balances.\n\n***Yearn Machine Learning*** follows the distribution model outlined below:\n\n* *Max Supply\u200a\u2014\u200a30,000 YML Tokens*\n* *Circulating Supply\u200a\u2014 10,500 YML Tokens*\n* *Team Tokens\u200a\u2014\u200a1,500 YML*\n* *Marketing/Development\u200a\u2014\u200a3,000 YML Tokens*\n* *Presale Tokens\u200a\u2014\u200a3,000 YML Tokens*\n* *Uniswap Liquidity\u200a\u2014\u200a3,000 YML Tokens*\n* *Locked YML (Unicrypt)\u200a\u2014 19,500 YML Tokens*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tsjxpk59hz961.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44cfa5206c5d3345bf04ec34974064b082c761a4\n\nHolders of ***YML*** are able to benefit off of the capabilities its machine learning provides while also enjoying staking rewards when contributing to the ***YML*** ecosystem. Holders who stake their tokens will be eligible to vote on governance policies and updated procedures, giving the project a dose decentralization. Voting will be conducted off chain to avoid gas-related issues that other DAO\u2019s face by using *Snapshot* to keep voting transparent, fair, and efficient.\n\nStaking rewards received for partaking in the network are distributed via a third party contract once a set amount has been accumulated through staking. The accumulated rewards will be distributed accordingly in correspondence with reward expectations per holder. The following APY schedule is provided for staking YML:\n\n* *Daily\u200a\u2014\u200a0.11%*\n* *Monthly\u200a\u2014\u200a3.33%*\n* *Yearly\u200a\u2014\u200a40%*\n\n*It is important to note that the YML team will receive a percentage of profits due to its decentralized structure as outlined in their whitepaper.*\n\nProviding a system which creates lower risk and increased opportunities at maximizing profit can be a game changer in the DeFi realm. DeFi has exploded and expanded into one of the biggest niches of cryptocurrency, but one of its biggest and most glaring problems is the risk involved. Lowering this risk is very difficult considering the decentralized nature of most yield farming and staking platforms.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, solving this problem comes with decreased decentralization in most cases which goes against the spirit of cryptocurrency and DeFi specifically. *YML* solves this problem by using proven machine learning methods which make SeFi a safer and more sustainable place. More importantly it still provides a level of decentralization that makes token holders comfortable. Building platforms that help yield farmers through machine learning is one of the most innovative and complex ways I\u2019ve come across. Artificial Intelligence is an incredibly useful tool, and I find it quite impressive that the developers at ***YML*** have created a way to take advantage of it.\n\n***Pertinent Links***:\n\n* *Website\u200a\u2014*\u200a*https://yearnml.finance*\n* *Twitter\u200a\u2014*\u200a*https://twitter.com/yearnmlfinance*\n* *Telegram News\u200a\u2014* *https://t.me/YMLNews*\n* *Telegram Community\u200a\u2014*\u200a*https://t.me/yearnmlfinance*\n* *Discord\u200a\u2014*\u200a*https://discord.gg/YwgjTA5t9s*\n* *Etherscan\u200a\u2014*\u200a*https://etherscan.io/token/0xD7E48d68DCE805C97bB66B2AfFaDcdFcd47E1F95*\n* *YML Forum\u200a\u2014*\u200a*https://yearnml.finance/forum/*\n\n*(I write articles, reviews, and Litepapers for legitimate, interesting, up and coming cryptocurrency projects.

So why did I do it then? Because while I am balls deep in crypto, I'm not irresponsibly so. I have crypto savings goals and I have old school savings goals. This is so that if I were to lose my crypto wallet or if ETH and BTC were to go to $0 tomorrow, no matter how unlikely, I am still on track to achieve my savings goals. I don't ever want to expose myself to the risk of not having any savings and having lost the last 4 years of saving to a black hole. So what I have done is set myself an annual minimum savings goal which I must meet each year, anything I save over that goes into crypto. This savings goal is enough for me to ensure that I can get on the property ladder before my 30s and hopefully own my own property outright by my 40s or 50s. I don't want that bare minimum financial dream of mine to be dependent on crypto. If crypto fails or I lose my wallet and I didn't put anything aside then I would be well on the way to forever renting and being a wage slave for the rest of my life. I can't let there be even a slight possibility of that even if it means I won't quite make the same sick gainz as I would otherwise this bull run.\n\n**You should also ask yourself the following:**\n\n>*Is my financial future entirely dependent on crypto?*\n\nIf the answer is yes then you are probably over-invested. Make sure you have a contingency plan so that you can still achieve some bare-minimum financial goals such as paying off debts by a certain date or owning your own property one day even if crypto fails. The only exception I would make to this is if you're working a low paying job, if you're quite old and have no savings/retirement plan or if you live in a country where such goals simply aren't possible by saving the old fashioned way. If any of these are you, having all of your eggs in the crypto basket is probably ok as any other methods of achieving your bare minimum financial goals aren't possible. Just be sure to do everything you can to reduce the risk of losing your crypto or getting scammed.\n\nFinally, you may think that ETH and/or BTC going up in price is a given long term or that crypto is too big to fail now. Well I would just about agree with you. However, please consider these two things:\n\n1. There are *many* and I mean *very many* ways for you to lose your crypto. ETH doesn't have to go to zero for you to lose everything if you get hacked because you left your crypto on an exchange or because you got phished. You could get sim swapped or you could copy/paste the wrong wallet address when transferring your funds. Someone could even put a gun to your head and rob you because you openly bragged about your 32 ETH. Hackers and scammers will always have new ways to catch you off guard. Don't ever let your guard down as nobody will come to your rescue once it is too late.\n\n2. When you spend all of your spare time learning about Ethereum, browsing r/ETHTrader, reading the r/EthFinance daily, browsing crypto twitter and watching crypto YouTube, you only ever see the bullish side. You're in an echo chamber. As a result, like me, you probably underestimate the risks which could see crypto lose value in the future. So while I personally find it super unlikely that crypto will go to $0 or fade into irrelevance (especially if you have a diversified portfolio and don't only hold assets on the Ethereum blockchain), it is important to reckognise your own limitations as a human being to be able to fairly asses the probabilities of different potential outcomes. I've spent nearly 4 years in this space and what scares me is not any particular threat wiping out crypto, but it is that everything seems so bullish and crypto adoption almost seems guaranteed that I worry that my own limitations to objectively assess the probabilities of different outcomes for crypto are why crypto seems like such a sure bet. Then one day, a black swan event will come and I'll wonder why the fuck I didn't see it coming.\n\n**Relevant Resources (old posts of mine):**\n\n*Most Relevant:* [Diversification and minimising risks](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/gyas6u/diversification_is_multifaceted_what_i_have/)\n\nMy previous post on creating an exit strategy and managing risk: [Do YOU Have an Exit Strategy?

(Correct me if you know)\n\n\\- USDT is in lots of AMM DEX pools with other stables, if USDT loses it's peg and goes to $0, the other stable in that pool will lose it's peg to by going much above $1, so that even can single handedly cause all stables to lose their pegs\n\n\\- That will cause a lot of people that have borrowed other stables against crypto to be undercollaterized, which will liquadate their crypto collateral at market price, causing the price of that crypto to tank, cause other people to be under-collaterized and so on.....the domino is quite obvious here.\n\n\\- There is a lot of BTC on Ethereum in various forms, some of them based on collateral, that collateral might depreciate way too fast, what would happen to the BTC on ethereum?\n\n\\- nobody seems to have used [tether.to](https://tether.to) to  redeem USDT for USD?\n\n\\- a lot of exchanges rely heavily on USDT \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne train of thought seems to be everyone will pour their depreciating USDT in crypto causing the prices to go even higher, but who will take it? Well AMM LP will be the first to suffer I suppose but what happens on  CEXes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe opposite and much harder to forsee domino effect will be the doomsday scenario, all stables losing their peg, mass liquadations, halted trading at CEXes and so on, but how far could that potentially reach effect wise? How long it can last?   \nPlease try to forsee the domino effect as far as possible as a fun thought experiment.\n\nHopefully nothing will happen at 15th or at least the US government won't react harshly knowing what that would cause, but still would be better to be prepared for all possible scenarios and excersize our thinking in the process.", "comments": [{"body": "My bet is it would be extremely wild at first, but ultimately I think you would see a flight to exchanges that deal with real USD and mass selling of crypto.

Here's a quick update on what's new in Ethereum:\n\n# Ethereum 2.0\n\nEthereum 2.0 phase 0 just rolled out a month ago in December.  It is the first step towards moving Ethereum to proof-of-stake.  The new chain is live and you can move ETH over to it and start staking (currently earns about 10% ROI annually). It is a one-way bridge and it does not allow for transactions yet, though, so your ETH is trapped over there if you decide to start staking. The rest of the functionality will come with phase 1 and phase 2 - and then we'll also turn off the ETH 1.0 proof-of-work chain. That's still probably a year or two away, though.\n\nMore info on staking at /r/ethstaker !\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# DeFi\n\nThe big hype in Ethereum is DeFi, or Decentralized Finance. Bitcoin famously allows you to \"be your own bank\", but really it's just you get your own bank account to hold and send money. DeFi is the rest of the bank. You can leverage, you can borrow, you can lend, you can trade, you can earn interest - all through smart contracts on Ethereum.\n\nThe biggest app on Ethereum (and is considered DeFi) is Uniswap. It's a decentralized exchange with the twist that all of the trading fees go towards liquidity providers. So you can be a trader and quickly exchange one asset for another (with a 0.3% fee) -or- you can be a supplier and let your crypto pile act as trading liquidity (and then you earn a share of the 0.3% fee as traders use it).  \n\nSome of the other big DeFi applications are SushiSwap, Yearn, Aave, Balancer, and Compound.  Each has its own unique quirks and intricacies. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Adoption & Transaction Fees\n\nUniswap, by itself, often earns more daily transaction fees than the entirety of Bitcoin. Ethereum usually does 3x-4x the transaction fees of Bitcoin on a daily basis.\n\nPeople are really using Ethereum, which is great, but the crazy demand on Ethereum is making transaction fees extremely high.   Daily transactions have been sustained at the old peak for the last 6 months:\n\n[https://etherscan.io/chart/tx](https://etherscan.io/chart/tx)\n\nA number of layer 2 solutions are in the works (and several are already available) to try and decrease the gas demand.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWelcome back to crypto!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh, also, we have donuts now on [r/ethtrader](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/)!

Where is a good place to start?", "comments": [{"body": "**On Ethereum:**\n\nAt its core, Ethereum does basically everything Bitcoin does but with the addition of smart contracts. Smart contracts are little chunks of code that run without any central operator or middleman.\n\nThe ELI5 example I like to give is imagine you and I are making a $10 bet on whether the Chiefs are going to win the super bowl this year. In the normal world, we either trust each other to pay up at the end, or we each give our $10 to someone to hold the money and act as an intermediary (and a lot of intermediaries charge fees for this kind of service and make big money). With Ethereum, though, we can actually give our $10 to a smart contract and then the smart contract can automatically pay out the pot to the winner, according to its code.\n\nSmart contracts can essentially remove intermediaries, whether they be in gambling, banking, or anything else. It gets way more intense and complex when you get into the details, but that's the high level picture of why smart contracts are awesome and powerful.\n\n`-----------------------------------`\n\n**On DeFi & dApps:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like to start with Uniswap, which is the biggest decentralized exchange on Ethereum. It is a monster, often accounting for 50% of activity on Ethereum and often generating more fees than the entirety of Bitcoin.\n\nLike any exchange, people can exchange one asset for another, and basically any asset running on Ethereum can be found on Uniswap.  (even ethtrader's donuts)\n\nThe novel thing about Uniswap is who the trading fees go to.  Think about how trading fees work on something like Coinbase.  You buy ETH, and Coinbase takes a small percentage for themselves.  On Uniswap, there is no middleman... no Coinbase gobbling up all the trading fees.  The trading fees instead go to the people that supply liquidity.\n\nAnd anyone can be a liquidity provider.  You, me, or your grandma.  Providers basically deposit money into Uniswap to facilitate trades. When people make trades on the platform, the trading fee is distributed across all of the liquidity providers, rather than going to Uniswap or its creators.\n\nSo an example: look at the Tether and Ethereum (USDT-ETH) pool. Alice is our liquidity provider and she comes along and deposits $1,000 worth of USDT and $1,000 worth of ETH into the liquidity pool. Bob is our trader, and he comes along to Uniswap and exchanges $100 worth of USDT for $99.70 worth of ETH. The missing 30 cents goes to Alice as a trading fee. Alice's holdings in the pool would also shift - she now has about $1,100.15 worth of USDT and $900.15 worth of ETH.\n\nThat's the basics. In reality, there's thousands of liquidity providers in that pool and Bob's trading fee gets distributed across all the liquidity providers, based off how much value they deposited. \n\nThe returns on a pool like this are pretty good (about 20%-30% per year), but obviously there are some unique risks and the ROI is not constant. If ETH price takes off, your share of the pool shifts to more USDT and less ETH. If ETH price tanks, you end up with lots more ETH and lots less USDT. Also, the returns are directly related to trading volume. You're essentially selling shovels in the gold rush as a liquidity provider. If no one is gold rushing, no one is buying shovels. Your returns also depend on how many other people are selling shovels. There is also risk with the smart contract security itself, though Uniswap is pretty battle tested by this point.\n\n`-----------------------------------`\n\nLemme know if you have any questions, will definitely try to answer.", "created": 1609877486.0}], "created": 1609866635.0}, {"title": "Why the volatility?", "text": "\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s no simple answer, but why is there so much volatility in crypto?

And it is going to $200 in the coming alt-season, in my humble opinion.\n\nUniswap's daily volume yesterday crossed $1 billion, not for the first time but it looks like it will sustain at such levels in coming days, weeks and months as ETH has crossed $1000 without much hype and with much criticism. Liquidity is over $2.7 billion, even when there are no incentives.\n\nInstitutional liquidity is flowing into Bitcoin and it will soon flow into Eth too. Eth will get it\u2019s CME futures, the OCC has given banks a go ahead for launching stablecoins on public blockchains and Ethereum has the ecosystem and toolset ready for everything that is about to come. After Bitcoin & Eth, DeFi governance tokens will be tokens people would want to hodl. And in that, the top ones. And when the HNIs & institutions (non crypto-native ones) start looking into DeFi, the first thing they\u2019d come to know about is the likes of UNI, Comp, etc., the products which are not much difficult to understand and have good reputation and are decentralized. By the time this happens, Uniswap will also likely be on Optimism with the cash-flow switch turned on. With the interest rates close to zero and negative, P/E ratios can virtually be infinite. That\u2019s another point to add to the value proposition. And don\u2019t forget Uniswap v3.\n\nBesides this, Uniswap is deeply integrated into the DeFi ecosystem and all the projects. MakerDAO now accepts Uniswap LP tokens for minting Dai. And also, think about this as betting on the Uniswap team. We know what the team is capable of and we know they\u2019re highly competent and innovation won\u2019t stop at v3. \n\nAt $200, Uniswap's fully diluted valuation will be $200 billion. So, really, am I being stupid here? Nope. $200 UNI will happen when BTC is above $100k, ETH is over $10k. When we're back to a Jan 2018 type of scenario. I'm not saying that it's an 'if', but a 'when'. Cardano, for context was trading at a fully diluted value of $40 billion in last cycle's alt-season, without any product or users, pure hype.\n\nAnd of course, $200 won\u2019t be sustainable for the next couple of years at least, but we are early. Even crypto people from 2017 don\u2019t want to hold crypto tokens for a few months. They just want to flip and most end up burning their ETH & BTC. Just by buying now and holding patiently would be rewarding imo.\n\nUNI is between $5 and $5.50 now and I\u2019m putting this out here that UNI is going to $200 in the coming alt-season.\n\nThe \"major\" competitor to Uniswap is Sushiswap, but at the end of the day, Sushiswap is just a fork project. They can add new features, refresh their front-end and blah blah but it is what it is- a fork. Sushiswap has volume and liquidity right now only because of its ongoing liquidity incentives. And Uniswap doesn't have it going right now. Look at what happened to Swerve (the Curve fork)- I think that is what will ultimately happen to Sushiswap. Sure, Sushiswap is now a part of Yearn Finance but you don't see new projects providing liquidity for their projects on Sushiswap, you don't see projects celebrating Sushiswap listings. Uniswap is the king in the DEX space.\n\nBalancer and other such tweaked and more innovative AMMs are good but the volume and liquidity on Uniswap speaks for itself.\n\nThe high gas fees problem- retail can't use it. Uniswap has shown us already that it can work well on Optimistic Rollups. And Optimism is starting their launch this month. In a few months, this won't be a problem and so we don't have to worry about AMM volumes being drained away to other blockchains.\n\nSo what I'm saying is, SEND IT!!!\n\nAnd above all, do your own research. This is not financial advice. Don\u2019t buy UNI just because I said so. Think for yourself. I'm not responsible for your losses or profits.\n\nI would love to hear what you all think about this :)", "comments": [{"body": "Best place to buy UNI?

It works by people inserting \"liquidity\" into a pool of assets that is used to facilitate trades. So it's really just a smart contract running on Ethereum. When people make trades on the platform, the trading fee is distributed across all of the liquidity providers.\n\nSo an example: look at the Tether and Ethereum (USDT-ETH) pool. Alice comes along and deposits $1,000 worth of USDT and $1,000 worth of ETH into the liquidity pool. Bob then comes along to Uniswap and exchanges $100 worth of USDT for $99.70 worth of ETH. The missing 30 cents goes to Alice as a trading fee. Alice's holdings in the pool would also shift - she now has about $1,100.15 worth of USDT and $900.15 worth of ETH.\n\nThat's the basics. In reality, there's thousands of liquidity providers in that pool and Bob's trading fee gets distributed across all the liquidity providers, based off how much value they deposited. This number of users also dampens the blow to Alice's balance between USDT and ETH in the pool.\n\nThe returns on a pool like this are pretty good, about 20%-30% per year, but obviously there are some unique risks. If ETH price takes off, your share of the pool shifts to more USDT and less ETH. If ETH price tanks, you end up with lots more ETH and lots less USDT. Also, the returns are directly related to trading volume. You're essentially selling shovels in the gold rush as a liquidity provider. If no one is gold rushing, no one is buying shovels. Your returns also depend on how many other people are selling shovels. There is also risk with the smart contract security itself, though Uniswap is pretty battle tested by this point, handling billions of dollars worth of crypto.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you have specific questions!", "created": 1609733456.0}, {"body": "Welcome back!

The idea originates from the Austrian School of Economics, in more specific work of Ludwig von Mises. $VLO is first of its kind, giving the first mover advance going forward. \n\n$VLO is community governed DAO, with very low market cap of 300k, and at accumulation stage. The project is under radar, but attracting more and more new stakeholders. It is a matter of time when people understand the concept and actually see the transformational power it carries. Significant marketing, BSC integration for growth and project X that implements the principles to other currencies are on their way. \n\n$VLO is build around a question of value, what it is, and how it is measured.\nVelocity of circulation of a currency has a direct impact on the value of the same currency in an economy; the velocity of circulation cannot be separated and it is a key aspect of present and future value.\n\n$VLO implements high mathematical formulas to the token economics\nIf there is no velocity for a currency, no usage, it cannot be very valuable. Unlike other rebase projects, VLO does not rebase on any price peg. For this there is a simple reason: it restricts the token value. Value can be only created on free markets and be based on free will, not determined by any outside factor. VLO protocol is expressing the value by measuring the velocity, which makes it totally unique defi protocol. \n\n$VLO tokeneconomics are very clever; the more there is velocity, the more the supply goes down, making it more prone to value appreciation. The rebase function reduces the supply, but at the same time it adjusts the price and the token holders own all the time the same % of the total supply. In addition, LP providers are incentived to provide liquidity, getting velocity based rewards. \n\nRead more about velocity in Medium blog: \n\n[https://link.medium.com/gxoImezdKcb](https://link.medium.com/gxoImezdKcb)\n\nWhite paper is available at GitHub: [https://github.com/velo-finance/velo-protocol/blob/master/VELO_Whitepaper_v1.1.pdf](https://github.com/velo-finance/velo-protocol/blob/master/VELO_Whitepaper_v1.1.pdf)\n\nThe project has been audited with full pass:\n\n[https://solidity.finance/audits/VELO/](https://solidity.finance/audits/VELO/)\n\nWebsite: \n[https://velotoken.fi](https://velotoken.fi)\n\nTG: \n[https://t.me/Velotoken](https://t.me/Velotoken)\n\nVLO welcomes you to join the movement and create a paradigm shift towards economies of real value, withouth centralized authority.", "comments": [], "created": 1609678692.0}, {"title": "Ethereum @ $832 on Coinbase Pro", "text": "It's a slippery slope to $1,000!

Each pool is an index that periodically updates its weights and tokens to better represent a market sector, such as defi or crypto generally, and is a high-fee AMM capable of generating revenue beyond the growth of the underlying assets.\n\nIndex tokens allow you to hold a single token which represents the top tokens in a market sector, and to easily manage your exposure to a market without needing to constantly manage your portfolio or research each tracked asset. Their prices also serve as benchmarks of general market performance that can be used to assess other investments.\n\n\nWhat's DEFI5?\n\nDEFI5 is a tokenized, passively managed index that tracks the top 5 DeFi tokens by market cap. The index autonomously updates its weights and tokens held using preset rules and on-chain market data. The value of the index is entirely determined by the value of the underlying assets, which are held by the portfolio in amounts proportional to their weights. There are no management fees, and DEFI5 tokens can be minted, burned or traded on demand to easily manage your exposure to the DeFi market.\n\n\nHow do you select tokens?\n\nTokens are selected automatically and weighted by market cap for the index from a DAO voted whitelist that meet the requirements for the category DEFI5 \n\n- The token is at least a week old.\n- No major vulnerabilities have been discovered in the token contract.\n- The token's supply can not be arbitrarily inflated or deflated maliciously and there are no transfer fees or other non-standard balance updates.\n- The token meets the requirements of the ERC20 standard.\n- The token has a fully diluted market cap of at least $50 million.\n- At least $1 million worth of liquidity is locked in the Uniswap market pair between the token and WETH.\n-The token is a protocol or governance token for a DeFi project.\n\n\nRebalances and Reweighs\n\nThe weights are updated every 7d and every 4 reweighs a Rebalance can be triggered to update the underlying tokens for the index from the categories above.\nThe actual token weights and balances gradually move toward the targets set by the reweighs and reindexes to minimize loss of funds from arbitrage.\n\n\nMinting and Burning\n\nNew index tokens can be minted by providing all the underlying tokens according to their weights. We created a uniswap auto minter which automatically purchases all the needed tokens and mints through uniswap. Index tokens can be burned to retrieve the underlying assets in proportion to the number of tokens burned, are fully collateralized at all times, and their value is based only on the value of the underlying assets.\n\n\nLink\n\nhttps://indexed.Finance", "comments": [], "created": 1609588129.0}, {"title": "Ethereum's value", "text": "How about next internet worth? \nBitcoin changes concept digital cash for digital gold.

These rallies were fueled mostly by institutions and big players. However the prices of assets crashed soon after.\n\nSince the USA government managed to get a hold of things by raising intrest rates to 20%. \n\n2011 saw another impressive gold and silver rally due to  US hesitation to raise the debt ceiling. Usually raising the debt ceiling happens automatically and quickly. There was a real possibility that the USA wouldn't be able to pay its debts.\n\nOnce the US raised the debt ceiling safe havens such as Gold and Silver tanked.\n\nWho remembers ww3?

I'm also actively mining the coin, as I believe in the tech behind it and want to support the network (and earn some XMR on the side).\n\nCurrently I have 100% of my veeeery small portfolio in BTC for obvious reasons. I'm considering buying into XMR and want to know if I'd be making a safe long-term investment. The Monero subs at r/monero and r/xmrtrading can be echo-chambers, so I figured I'd come here for some correction and less-biased opinions.\n\nMonero has been involved in many different events lately:  \n- Unknown attackers have attempted to compromise the Monero network, unsuccessfully.  \n- Monero was recently delisted from many exchanges.  \n- The French are introducing a new law that effectively bans Monero usage.  \n- Lots of darknet markets are abandoning Bitcoin in favor of Monero, with many requiring Monero usage.\n\nThe Monero community sees these events as validation that their tech works. They have successfully withstood the network attacks with little consequence, governments trying to complicate or ban XMR usage seems to be them admitting they can't trace the currency, and darknet markets who require privacy to elude law enforcement are migrating en masse to Monero. This last one is particularly important; the Monero community notes that Bitcoin first gained popularity in the dark net, and then spread outwards from there.\n\nThe Monero community claims that XMR is the \"true\" Bitcoin that Satoshi advocated for in their original paper. I don't know if I agree with this sentiment, but I think it's certainly impossible to argue against Monero's suitability as a truly private cryptocurrency.\n\nI personally have two reasons to believe that Monero could soon become a major player in the crypto market:  \n- In the near future: [Atomic swaps between BTC/XMR are under development.](https://amp.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/ilyv9u/atomic_swap_implementation_supporting_monero/) Once complete, they will allow for easy switching between BTC & XMR that's secure, decentralized, and anonymous. This will render BTC/XMR exchanges obsolete.  \n- In the farther future: [Monero is researching hardening their network against quantum attackers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/kcl547/ama_research_team_analyzing_the_implications_of/?utm_source=amp&utm_medium=&utm_content=post_body) Quantum computers may be able to undo the algorithms all cryptocurrencies rely on for security. Monero seems to be unique among all coins in their active efforts to quantum-proof their blockchain and preserve privacy & security in the face of a powerful quantum attacker.\n\nNow this is all fine and dandy, and frankly the tech is incredible. But how does it translate to adoption of Monero as a real currency and increasing its value?\n\nThis is why I'm here. Knowing all this, how do all of you believe Monero will fare in the short- and long-term? Do you think that Monero could have what it takes to stand alongside Bitcoin as a viable replacement for fiat currencies? Will I see a return by HODLing Monero?", "comments": [{"body": "I thought I read somewhere recently a few exchanges have removed them but I might be wrong", "created": 1610147287.0}, {"body": "Can\u2019t hurt to have a small percent in Monero but I would keep a majority with BTC and ETH.

Stop trying to second guess what others may do, and think more about what **you** want to achieve. If you really are looking for financial privacy then f\\* the regulators, it's nobody's business but yours.\n\nMonero is not \"the true bitcoin\", the code is very different. I can't speak too much about it as I've never used it and I have little interest in it. The developers come across as bright people but the communities are stupidly toxic.\n\nIn it's past, monero was retroactively cracked, revealing at least 20% of transactions. Probably it's better now but it goes to show the nature of the beast, it's always going to be a moving target.\n\nYou also need to keep in mind that the auditing of the chain and having privacy creates a conflict. If, say, an inflation bug occurs, you may never know about those extra coins. Just a few years ago, bitcoin had a near death experience when a (yet another) infinite inflation bug was discovered... and that's a chain with clear auditing and the world's eyes on it! Can you imagine the added difficulty that poses for privacy coins?\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/the-latest-bitcoin-bug-was-so-bad-developers-kept-its-full-details-a-secret](https://www.coindesk.com/the-latest-bitcoin-bug-was-so-bad-developers-kept-its-full-details-a-secret)\n\nHaving said that, on balance, I prefer privacy coins. Just keep in mind, different strokes for different folks.\n\nThe most interesting privacy coins are based on MimbleWimble, which is very elegant in design. Individual transactions are never stored on chain, boosting both privacy and efficiency at the same time. However, most of the work to identify users is not done on chain, but rather through behavioral analysis or targeted attacks. Let's not forget how Tails OS was compromised.\n\nRegarding atomic swaps, while they are very helpful, liquidity can be a problem.

For an outsider it looks like they know shit is about to hit the fan and want to buy as much unseizable crypto assets as possible before the end.\n\n\\- Market cap when they admitted they have only 76% backing in 2018 was $2B, it's $22B now \n\n\\- USDT is by far having the biggest trading volume against any crypto\n\n\\- Their last \"audit\" was in 2018 and it looked like a joke, they actually never provided proper audit of their reserves, never.\n\n\\- They always mint tether in big round number, like $800M just the other day. I find it hard to believe that deposits of investors always add-up to a round number. Look USDC mints for example, they are always like 23939394\n\n\\- Nobody seems to know where they bank right now? (Correct me if you know)\n\n\\- USDT is in lots of AMM DEX pools with other stables, if USDT loses it's peg and goes to $0, the other stable in that pool will lose it's peg to by going much above $1, so that even can single handedly cause all stables to lose their pegs\n\n\\- That will cause a lot of people that have borrowed other stables against crypto to be undercollaterized, which will liquadate their crypto collateral at market price, causing the price of that crypto to tank, cause other people to be under-collaterized and so on.....the domino is quite obvious here.\n\n\\- There is a lot of BTC on Ethereum in various forms, some of them based on collateral, that collateral might depreciate way too fast, what would happen to the BTC on ethereum?\n\n\\- nobody seems to have used [tether.to](https://tether.to) to  redeem USDT for USD?\n\n\\- a lot of exchanges rely heavily on USDT \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne train of thought seems to be everyone will pour their depreciating USDT in crypto causing the prices to go even higher, but who will take it? Well AMM LP will be the first to suffer I suppose but what happens on  CEXes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe opposite and much harder to forsee domino effect will be the doomsday scenario, all stables losing their peg, mass liquadations, halted trading at CEXes and so on, but how far could that potentially reach effect wise? How long it can last?   \nPlease try to forsee the domino effect as far as possible as a fun thought experiment.\n\nHopefully nothing will happen at 15th or at least the US government won't react harshly knowing what that would cause, but still would be better to be prepared for all possible scenarios and excersize our thinking in the process.", "comments": [{"body": "Sounds like a smorgasbord for unleveraged wimps like myself", "created": 1609961859.0}, {"body": "It can be the end of this bull rum and we can see a big retracement of all cryptos.

The senator, reportedly said, \"If we reach the point where we have overspent so much that things start crashing down, the black swan event occurs with any regard to any fiat currency...there is a backstop available to every government in the world and that backstop is bitcoin,\" Lummis said.  \n\nThe senator-elect also said that bitcoin is a better store of value than paper money because the cryptocurrency's supply is finite. Bitcoin is indeed the currency of the 21st century, gone is the era of plastic money which has several flaws (e.g. being centralized and traceable). The Blockchain has several innovative dapps like online decentralized casino, [EarnBet](https://play.earnbet.io/) which seeks to overthrow traditional casinos, Chain-link which has untamperable oracle services, and best of all, Ethereum which allows developers to create an app using its technology. Recently, even Coca-Cola expressed an interest in using its mainnet, showing its untapped potential and massive application.  \n\nLastly, bitcoin is inflation-proof and there is a direct correlation between an economy's inflation and the use of cryptocurrencies. For example, a decent population of Venezuela uses cryptocurrencies as they have finally realized how 'redundant' fiat is and inflation can distort is function of acting as money, i.e. serving as a store of value.

I don't doubt that. But I keep hearing how fast BCH is when in fact it has the same 10 minute block confirmation time as BTC. Thus it is not faster, it's just cheaper. \n\nMy conclusion is that if someone wants faster and cheaper transactions on the first layer, then they could use LTC since it has \\~2.5m confirmation time (although it tends to orphan blocks more often because of that).\n\nOr am I wrong about something in regards to BTC speed?", "comments": [{"body": "bch has zero conf for most usecases other than exchanges", "created": 1610188329.0}, {"body": "I think what people mean about BCH being faster than BTC, is that if you send a 1 cent fee transaction (which used to be the accepted standard on BTC), you will get into a block quickly on BCH and you'll be waiting until the end of time unless you know a charitable miner on BTC.  Thus it is \"faster\" to get confirmations on the BCH blockchain.  Like you say though, this is in some respects really just saying that it's cheaper.  But they are somewhat connected, because if the average user can't afford to pay $10 a transaction every time (and they probably can't) then BCH is effectively a lot faster.\n\nIn addition, BCH users are more likely to accept 0 confirmation transactions, at the time of the split there was huge controversy about whether or not 0 confirmation transactions were acceptable or secure, for BCH the answer was \"we should try and preserve it as a yes\" and the BTC crowd went with \"no\".  And they even made their 0 confirmation transactions LESS reliable with Replace By Fee.  So in this kind of consideration, BCH could be considered \"faster\" in a way because the point at which a merchant will consider the transaction \"secure enough\" is hit quicker.\n\nI suppose there are also outside occurrences where BCH has faster block times than BTC, because it has a more adaptive difficulty adjustment algorithm.  So in scenarios where BTC's hash rate crashed massively just after a difficulty adjustment, there would be slower than 10 minute block times for > 2 weeks.\n\nAs for LTC I don't know, it's probably not faster even with these somewhat obtuse angles of reasoning.  I don't know who is claiming that.", "created": 1610188446.0}, {"body": "It's faster even with the same 10 min confirmation block times because you can have around 32 times as many transactions within that 10 minutes for Bitcoin Cash compared to BTC. Bitcoin Cash's capacity is also higher than LTC. But Bitcoin Cash is more than just fast cheap and reliable, it also has many unique advantages over the old Bitcoin. Here are the improvements from Bitcoin Cash.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Better Security** \u2013 BTC has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations. This RBF security vulnerability exists only in BTC and not Bitcoin Cash. That's why Bitcoin Cash is more secure as a payment method.\n\nHere is an example of hackers stolen $150000 worth of BTC using the RBF security vulnerability. https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/03/14/double-spenders-scam-150000-bitcoin/\n\nIt is super easy to double spend on Bitcoin using the RBF vulnerability. Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/video-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-double-spend-btc-using-rbf/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Improved Scalability** \u2013 BTC is limited to 1MB block size and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 32x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle PayPal transactions volume today and be global money after a few more upgrades.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Supply Scarcity** \u2013 During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than BTC.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Improved Confirmation Times** \u2013 Due to the limited block size of BTC, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old BTC, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Higher Merchants Adoption** - Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today. Source: https://1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame\n\nWhile Bitcoin Cash adoption is growing very quickly every single day, Bitcoin is having declining adoption and if this trend continues then Bitcoin is on a dead end. Source: https://np.reddit.com/r/NotAcceptingBitcoin/top/?sort=top&t=all\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Low Fees** \u2013 One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of BTC, fees have exceeded over $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Lightning Network Problems And Vulnerabilities And Loss Funds** - Some people may claim Lightning Network will solve Bitcoin problems but it has failed to gain traction due to many problems and vulnerabilities, such as loss of funds, unreliable transactions (constantly failing), and many other vulnerabilities.\n\nSource: https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/why-does-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-fail-new-study-proves-inefficiency/\n\nSource: https://news.bitcoin.com/researchers-scathing-lightning-network-analysis-finds-flaws/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Tokens** - Bitcoin Cash has tokens to start taking some marketshare from Ethereum. Today, anyone can issue their own loyalty tokens or digital money on Bitcoin Cash from as low as 1 cent to mint it. It's incredibly easy and anyone can do it at https://mint.bitcoin.com/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Better Privacy** - Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle/CashFusion. You can enable it through the setting in the Electron Cash wallet and it's completely optional. If you don't want others to know how you spent your money, it is better to use Bitcoin Cash over BTC.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Better Risk/Reward** - If BTC gains another 500 billion marketcap, it only 2x in price. But that same 500 billion will give you more than 80x your Bitcoin Cash investments. It is such a smarter option given the risk/rewards probabilities.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt the moment, the old BTC has first mover advantage but that can only last them so long.

And meanwhile, you\u2019ve paid sky-high transaction fees, and someone else can outbid you to kick you out of your place in line to get confirmed!\n\nOn BCH, however, you can safely use & trust ZERO CONFIRMATION, which means that your transaction is as good as confirmed as soon as you hit send. If you are concerned or it\u2019s a high dollar amount, you can wait ~10 minutes for confirmation. On BCH, your transaction will always get confirmed in the next block.

Non-mining nodes don\u2019t really do much for the network security, and their main use is to watch for double spends, which isn\u2019t something most users need.  Also, by making bitcoin unusable from high fees, you\u2019re going to lose the nodes that merchants would run if it were worth it to accept bitcoin.\n\nBCH also has some other improvements in things like smart contracts and block propagation systems.\n\nEdit: the minority that wanted large blocks was also actually the vast majority until about 2017.  The main bitcoin forums like r/bitcoin and bitcointalk are/were all controlled by the same person who censored anything pro-big blocks.

I bought it after a couple of days lurking from this subs. and this is the first time I bought cryptocurrency.\n\nI bought it for the reason of I THINK because it's still cheap so it's good for me to save my money in BCH.\n\nthings I want to get clear of for the next time and I am so grateful to hear any advice to me are:\n\n1. so the transaction was very fast, it does not takes until 1 hours to get the BCH into my wallet. is that reason why BCH is good? but I never bought BTC before so I don't know how long it takes to transaction in BTC, I just thought of the blockchain in BCH is bigger that's why it is fast so this must be one of the benefit right?\n2. how is the wallet on this app works? I learn crypto from r/BitcoinBeginners . the sub suggest me to have software called electrum but I don't see electrum support bitcoin cash. also is the seed phrase (12 letters readable words) is enough for me to login in any devices I want later just in case I change my phone etc? I write it on paper. is that really enough to secure my money? can I login with same phrase to any of crypto wallet? they say wallet is attach at blockchain right? so can I use my seed to login to anywhere (I never tried but I just wonder). the backup functionality on this app ([bitcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com)) is not working, it is cannot be saved anywhere in phone's memory (it always failed to save or even send the backup file to whatsapp) what can I do to backup my account? is email and seed enough?\n3. how to see the chart? sometime the value of BTC or BTH is red or green. which one is good to buy or sell? any cool tips / tricks on how to interpret chart? (not necessarily for buy and sell only)\n4. I don't have enough money to buy hardware wallet. is that okay for me to save everything just using the app wallet? (I know many people don't agree with this) but the app integrates with my email address so I can login with my email address anywhere right as long as I use this app? \n5. it bitcoin core same as bitcoin? the people here sometime trashing bitcoin sometime bitcoin core. they have different logo one with black color one with orange color\n6. before I buy BCH on bitcoin wallet, I register 2 bitcoin transaction LUNO and COINBASE. coinbase does not support my country, however LUNO on the other hand support my country but until now they haven't even finish reviewing my account. how can such a bitcoin wallet does not need to identify me to buy something? why those 2 apps I previously installed need and takes so much time to allow me to do transaction?\n7. if I buy BCH like I am right now, is there any reason why I should also buy BTC too? or it just better for me to continue saving my money buying BCH?\n8. and last, people says no transaction fee using BCH, what does that mean? I just bought it and it takes my money more than the value I buy when buying it. ex: I wanna buy $100, it takes me about $103 dollar for the app to let me buy it (I don't use dollar btw this is just example).\n\nAny hardcore advice such \"You damn stupidly wrong, do like this instead ...\" is really appreciated.

Bitcoin Cash is what Bitcoin used to be, a low friction limited supply currency which will be the future of money.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1. The speed at which your transaction pops up is the speed at which it is broadcast around the network (very fast) rather than the speed that it confirms into the blockchain (takes a little time).  This is the way most cryptocurrencies work, and it's not related to the size of the blockchain.  Bitcoin (Core) takes a long time currently because they have jammed up their entire network and have no plan for undoing that, which was the whole reason Bitcoin Cash split off in the first place.\n2. Electrum doesn't support Bitcoin Cash, but the Bitcoin Cash version is called Electron Cash you can try that.  https://electroncash.org/  Yes, your seed is all you need for a backup and it can be used to recover your coins from any Bitcoin Cash software in the future if you need to do that.  Just be careful with it!\n3. I can't really help you with chart reading, there's a bunch of sites that display good information though and I'm sure you can figure it out yourself. I like https://coin.dance/ quite a lot.\n4. It's fine to use the app because to start I assume you're not putting in tons and tons of money into crypto but as you get more familiar with things or invest more you might want to consider a hardware wallet.\n5. When people here talk about Bitcoin Core they mean the currency labelled \"Bitcoin\" on most websites yes.  If they say \"Bitcoin\" they could mean Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Cash depending on the context.\n6. I imagine those apps you're talking about have a lot of legal regulation that require them to know who you are to send you coins.  Bitcoin (Core or Cash) has no inherent requirement for that, but some services that interact with it do.\n7. That's a matter of opinion and you can make up your own mind.  In my opinion Bitcoin Core is a basically unusable mess with constantly increasing fees and a community focussed on getting rich instead of building a new currency and therefore a speculative bubble.  Following that logic, I prefer buying BCH and don't really bother with BTC any more.  This is just my opinion though, I encourage you to look around for others and make up your own mind.\n8. Again, the fee to buy BCH depends on the service you are using (for instance Coinbase).  When people talk about the fees, they usually mean the fee to send BCH you already own on the network to another BCH address (e.g. using Electron Cash) rather than taking BCH out of an external service which holds the coins on your behalf and which adds its own extra fees (e.g. Coinbase).", "created": 1610108329.0}, {"body": ">I just bought my first cryptocurrency...  ...and now I am really looking for advice...\n\nIs this the right order to be doing things with money?", "created": 1610109507.0}, {"body": "You sir have a functional brain. \n\nWelcome to p2p money.\n\nCongrats and GLHF", "created": 1610130044.0}, {"body": "u/chaintip", "created": 1610121435.0}, {"body": "4.

If you really needed something, you could easily lose a substantial amount of the value of what you're trading.\n\nFor example - say we're in a barter-only economy and you were in desperate need of a water pump. There are a few available, but the only thing you have extra at the time is a few head of sheep.\n\nNow let's also say that (for example) given a system with USD available in a free market, we knew that one head of sheep generally fetched around $600 while the water pump was around $300.\n\nIf you could sell the sheep to *anybody* you'd get $600 in value out of it.\n\nBut let's say that of all the water pumps available, only one person needs a sheep... and they don't need a sheep that badly.\n\nWater is also a necessity and they know you can't go long without it.\n\nThey may actually manage to get you to agree to part with not one, but perhaps 2 or 3 sheep... because you don't have the luxury of money to freely trade, nor the luxury of time to barter around for a better deal.\n\nIf you part with 2 head of sheep ($1200) for a single water pump ($300) - money in that instance would be worth $900 to you.\n\nSo money *does* have intrinsic value because it makes the entire system of trade much easier.\n\nAnd the goal of Cryptocurrency is to become that worldwide base in which trade occurs. To make it extraordinarily easy to pay for *anything, anywhere* regardless of border, jurisdiction, controlling currency, etc.\n\nAs more and more people start accepting cryptocurrency as a payment mechanism, the *better* that system becomes and the more valuable it becomes as a stand-in for trade. The more people that accept it, the more liquid it becomes.\n\nHeck - if it becomes a standard worldwide currency, it *will become* liquidity.\n\nPeople currently define liquidity as cash on hand...\n\nIn the world we're shooting for, liquidity will be the amount of crypto on hand.\n\nAs long as a cryptocurrency is shooting to fill the demand for worldwide transactions, this could easily become a reality.\n\n**TL;DR - The mechanism that gives cryptocurrency value is the same mechanism that gives money itself value. If the grasp of cryptocurrency continues to grow, the value of that cryptocurrency as a mechanism of trade will grow in a similar fashion.**", "created": 1609864088.0}, {"body": "Police steal billions from people in civil forfeiture.

There is nothing inevitable about electricity, internet, and other infrastructure going down. \n\nFiat means by decree. Fiat currency is money that is circulated and used only because the state says that it must be used. And the state is the official counterfeiter of the fiat currency, meaning they can print as much as they want and give it to whoever they want. A byproduct of this is that the state gives orders to the banks and payment processors about who is or isn't allowed to use the official currency. \n\nMost people would simply assume this is the right way to order a monetary system. But it it not order. It is chaos. One entity making all the decisions regarding money - the fundamental medium by which we all interact and help each other out - is a recipe for disaster, as history has shown. Fiat currencies, on average, have a lifespan of about 50 years before they hyperinflate or otherwise get decimated. That is not order or stability. It is chaotic and unstable. That's mostly because the official counterfeiters cannot resist printing their currency to enrich themselves and their friends. Combine that with massive debt and fractional-reserve banking and it's a trap that's basically impossible to escape from without severe financial consequences one way or another.\n\nCryptocurrency is the solution to all this chaos. There is no central authority demanding that everyone uses it, so it is purely voluntary. There is no official counterfeiter who can print more money on demand to give to themselves or their friends. Therefore it cannot hyperinflate and destroy itself. Since cryptocurrency is designed so that individuals can easily control it without going through a 3rd party, it becomes very difficult to engage in fractional-reserve banking. You can't create more of it through debt. It is a true asset, the opposite of fiat currency (which represents debt). Since anyone using the network can send value to anyone else on the network, there is no need for payment processors or other intermediaries. \n\nAll these qualities make cryptocurrency a total game changer for the economy (which is simply the sum total of how we all interact). The state can't choose winners and losers when people use crypto. The state can't keep anyone locked out of the greater economy when they use crypto. When people use cryptocurrency, the system of money needs no reset because it will not hyperinflate or otherwise be destroyed due to state actions. People cannot have their value sucked away through inflation, which means they can continue to build wealth without worrying about the damage done by monetary policy.\n\nThis is all extremely revolutionary.

This is what most merchants who accept large or frequent amounts of cryptocurrency do. Bitpay is one example, coinpayments.net is another, etc. etc. This service is not possible if you receive payments through the Bitcoin.com wallet. **However**, if you don't expect a lot of customers to pay you in cryptocurrency, then another option is simply to send your BCH after getting paid, to an exchange like Coinbase.com or Kraken.com, and then sell for USD. That is a perfectly acceptable solution as well if you're only getting a few transactions in cryptocurrency every now and then. Alternatively, a third option is just to hold.\n\nThe Bitcoin.com wallet is a fantastic wallet for merchants (truly one of the best in terms of usability).

Check here for real time data: [https://fiatleak.com/](https://fiatleak.com/)\n\nIf you have more reasons why it is world currency post them I would like to know your opinions.", "comments": [{"body": "There is no way that a logical person/business prefers to pay higher fees for a slow unreliable service when there is a cheaper better faster alternative Bitcoin Cash. Try sending $10 worth of Bitcoin and $10 worth of Bitcoin Cash to yourself and see for yourself the difference. But Bitcoin Cash is more than just fast cheap and reliable, it also has many unique advantages over the old Bitcoin. Here are the improvements from Bitcoin Cash.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Better Security** \u2013 BTC has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations. This RBF security vulnerability exists only in BTC and not Bitcoin Cash. That's why Bitcoin Cash is more secure as a payment method.\n\nHere is an example of hackers stolen $150000 worth of BTC using the RBF security vulnerability. https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/03/14/double-spenders-scam-150000-bitcoin/\n\nIt is super easy to double spend on Bitcoin using the RBF vulnerability. Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/video-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-double-spend-btc-using-rbf/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Improved Scalability** \u2013 BTC is limited to 1MB block size and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 32x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle PayPal transactions volume today and be global money after a few more upgrades.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Supply Scarcity** \u2013 During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than BTC.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Improved Confirmation Times** \u2013 Due to the limited block size of BTC, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old BTC, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Higher Merchants Adoption** - Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today. Source: https://1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame\n\nWhile Bitcoin Cash adoption is growing very quickly every single day, Bitcoin is having declining adoption and if this trend continues then Bitcoin is on a dead end. Source: https://np.reddit.com/r/NotAcceptingBitcoin/top/?sort=top&t=all\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Low Fees** \u2013 One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of BTC, fees have exceeded over $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Lightning Network Problems And Vulnerabilities And Loss Funds** - Some people may claim Lightning Network will solve Bitcoin problems but it has failed to gain traction due to many problems and vulnerabilities, such as loss of funds, unreliable transactions (constantly failing), and many other vulnerabilities.\n\nSource: https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/why-does-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-fail-new-study-proves-inefficiency/\n\nSource: https://news.bitcoin.com/researchers-scathing-lightning-network-analysis-finds-flaws/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Tokens** - Bitcoin Cash has tokens to start taking some marketshare from Ethereum. Today, anyone can issue their own loyalty tokens or digital money on Bitcoin Cash from as low as 1 cent to mint it. It's incredibly easy and anyone can do it at https://mint.bitcoin.com/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Better Privacy** - Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle/CashFusion. You can enable it through the setting in the Electron Cash wallet and it's completely optional. If you don't want others to know how you spent your money, it is better to use Bitcoin Cash over BTC.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Better Risk/Reward** - If BTC gains another 500 billion marketcap, it only 2x in price. But that same 500 billion will give you more than 80x your Bitcoin Cash investments. It is such a smarter option given the risk/rewards probabilities.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt the moment, the old BTC has first mover advantage but that can only last them so long.

Sideways movement after a large pump. Its red days had higher volume than the prior green days. That's distribution. We're not seeing that here. We're seeing the opposite.\n\nThis tells us what is occurring, but obviously doesn't tell us the future actions of market participants. Someone with 1B doge could decide he wants to cash out, and that will put a lot of downward pressure on the price. So even though we are witnessing accumulation at this price point, the future isn't guaranteed. The best that traders have is interpreting the now, and making bets with probability in their favor. Continued upside movement is the more probable bet here.\n\nEdit: **I want to stress this point:** If this method of interpreting supply and demand worked *flawlessly*, than I (and many others) would be excessively wealthy.

Because Dogecoin is truly unique, it is it\u2019s own species of cryptocurrency, and we don\u2019t understand it and that\u2019s okay.\n\nMemes play a role in shaping culture of society. Currently we understand memes as images on our screens that we relate to. If this is the case then memes have existed in the past and will clearly evolve into the future. \n\nDogecoin is the product of the economy and memes colliding into one, it is beyond our current comprehension. It isn\u2019t investing into cloud computing, artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, rather it is investing into the very economic system in which all transactions will occur. \n\nOne day we will understand, maybe tomorrow, maybe EOY 2021, 2022, 2023, 10 years from now, 20 years. \n\nYou might think, \u201cit\u2019s a joke, a dog coin\u201d and in your head you think about how ridiculous exchanges would be using a worthless coin with the portrait of a shiba inu.

At least right now, in our current paradigm. \n\nBut notice how we use dollars. An example: A one dollar bill with the \u201call seeing eye pyramid\u201d and \u201cnew world order\u201d written across it with all seriousness. It is a symbol, and symbols change over time. They change so much that after some time it loses it\u2019s meaning and becomes the norm. \n\nIn the future people may use Dogecoin without even thinking twice. Day to day, normal use. An image of a doge, loyal and noble. Much like we use dollars with images of significant historical people.\n\nDon\u2019t you think people thought it was strange using little symbols and pictures at first? And yet now we accept it, and sacrifice our lives for it?\n\nAll you have to do now and can do now is HODL, HODL and it will pay off.

If BTC shot up a lot higher, it would get more likely, but still...\n\nSo we're probably not going to see anything close to $5 for quite a while. Something just short of $0.10 is also probably going to take a while, but it's not out of the realms of possibility to see it get close in the short term. $0.02 to $0.04 could totally happen overnight, but it could also go right back to $0.003.\n\nBecause of the low value per Doge, a lot of people have the mistaken impression that getting in now would be like getting into BTC in 2011.

Because of the history of Dogecoin (a history that didn\u2019t include it being investment-based), people aren\u2019t so welcoming of those trying to change the purpose of Dogecoin. The fact that Dogecoin has a near unlimited supply reflects the sentiment that it is more of a community than a currency.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m fine with people making a profit. After all, if people couldn\u2019t make profits off of Dogecoin then they would have no reason to join the community and be exposed to it. It\u2019s almost similar to the argument that I heard a lot of people make when Guitar Hero came out \u2014 \u201cyou found the song from guitar hero so you\u2019re not a real fan\u201d \u2014 but at the same time people wouldn\u2019t have been exposed to that music had Guitar Hero not existed.\n\nThere will always be traditionalists out there who will despise anyone who isn\u2019t 100% into something for the reasons that they are, so don\u2019t mind them, there should always be a balance.", "created": 1610052409.0}, {"body": "It\u2019s a joke about the entire financial system using doge as its base currency.

People started to use it as an exchange medium not for value or gain but for things, then people started to use it to give to others to show appreciation for assorted things. Doge had merchants by day two which in the scope of everything that exists in cryptocurrency is a bit abnormal. It did create a foundation for commerce which at this point Doge is one of the most accepted cryptocurrencies that exist, placing top 10 in many and top 20 in most for usage. The engagement level here is not 1.50$ for something like a game key but 151.5358811 Doge (rounded up typically) to 153 or 160 Doge.\n\n[Cryptwerk](https://cryptwerk.com/analytics/) is one of the only ones putting analytics public facing, they have 25 different assets engaged; Doge sits 7th. ^(Real talk, one day I do hope that all of the different merchant platforms are putting figures frontal. The backside data to things is amazing in a way that many people would not expect.)\n\nThe notation also has roots to at the end of it all a Dogecoin is simply a Dogecoin, there is 0 inherent value tied to things. If you have 5 Doge then you have 5 Doge not  0.00000127 BTC or 0.04949341 USD. Price and value are external to everything as that is dictated by third party engagements, Dogecoins can/are still gotten for just mining cost power.\n\n>I see this also referenced with people being upset about others looking for an opportunity to make a profit. \n\nWhen it is done here, it is less directly about making a profit and more the manner in which the discussion around it is happening. This place has rules, the rules have not changed and they are by communal dictation. Price posts, speculation..Have never been allowed [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/wiki/dogecoinrules) The price ticker in the sidebar is also tagged to Dogecoin price ticker: \u01101 = \u01101.\n\n>If you're not investing ultimately looking for a larger payout,\n\nDogecoin is not an [investment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/hnm8hr/raid_raid_raid/fxcczt8/)\n\n>what's the reason to invest in the first place?\n\nThere are no [investors.](https://old.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/9pqox7/when_will_doge_moon/e84jpu8/)\n\n>I've seen people say they are doing it in order to purchase other stocks, but is that not the same concept? \n\nMany of the people posting here, have never been to the subreddit before the past few days. This is not to say that they are not allowed, but the perception of things in relation to the current content vs the normal content here is skewed heavily. It happens whenever there is something going on elsewhere, [stats](https://subredditstats.com/r/dogecoin) can be put against a market chart with fun similarities. Those sharp jumps and drastic drop offs, those are moments like current where things get a massive flood of interest that lingers for a short while then poofs. Not saying that it is bad, just that during these times it is not an actual reflection of the community here. \n\n>Seriously confused when I see people say 1 doge = 1 doge and get upset when people talk about making a cash profit.\n\nIt is a very hard line to walk between the existing community and dealing with the influx of people who from a community standpoint are valid, they have the rights to engage, they are welcomed and in turn having awareness for just what this place is along with respecting that. This is all something shiny, new, exciting for people yet it is getting lost that in the scope of it all many people are sort of just rushing threw with bats instead of wiping their feet at the door. Which is something that has ongoing been a struggle as every time that little chart there goes swoosh in turn many of the natives here just hide elsewhere and wait it out, or their time is spent attempting to engage with new people and being rebuffed real hard for trying to help answer or note things. \n\nSpeculation makes up about 25% of the usage for Dogecoin while it is less than the primary usage, there is still acknowledgement that they are users too. Dogecoin users come from many different interests, my only thing in this all is that I wish people would take the time to learn about what exactly it is that they are playing with. Market people get wiped out being too focused on micro level while macro comes and just sweeps them off into the red sea. Users who engage in functional ways are really bad at times in relation to holding their own assets; so they lose them often in trading ease for security. Service providers while doing amazing things, can do incredibly stupid things like failing to make backups or derping servers into the void. Learning, being aware, having awareness. This would be my only criticism but it is not specific to any side of the fences.\n\nThis is a bit much to read, the issue under it is sort of complicated while not being specific to just this place. There is validity to the annoyance that people can have in the same this is a place for everyone. Personally I move between them all, I hate to discuss economics yet find myself having to do that more and more in an effort to actually explain to people here *what* is actually going on.

It should help you gain some perspective:\n\nThere are about 6,800 times more Doge in circulation than BTC.\n\nDoge is just behind LTC at the moment in popularity. LTC has a market cap of about $10.2 billion. If Doge approaches that, it will be approaching $0.10. But all cryptos are likely to keep trending up; so that number gets higher.\n\nIf Doge reached the same market cap as BTC, then it would be worth about $5.92. This seems incredibly unlikely to happen given how much more popular BTC is. If BTC shot up a lot higher, it would get more likely, but still...\n\nSo we're probably not going to see anything close to $5 for quite a while. Something just short of $0.10 is also probably going to take a while, but it's not out of the realms of possibility to see it get close in the short term. $0.02 to $0.04 could totally happen overnight, but it could also go right back to $0.003.\n\nBecause of the low value per Doge, a lot of people have the mistaken impression that getting in now would be like getting into BTC in 2011. That's not the case, though. It's more like getting into BTC at the start of 2018 which was still a really good time to get into BTC. The only difference is that BTC is like Coca Cola, and Doge is like RC.\n\nEDIT: Note - This information is a day or two old at this point, and cryptos move fast.

The bigger issue is how many Doge are in circulation.\n\nThis is because there are about 6,800 times more Doge in circulation than BTC.\n\nDoge is just behind LTC at the moment in popularity. LTC has a market cap of about $10.2 billion. If Doge approaches that, it will be approaching $0.10. But all cryptos are likely to keep trending up; so that number gets higher.\n\nIf Doge reached the same market cap as BTC, then it would be worth about $5.92. This seems incredibly unlikely to happen given how much more popular BTC is. If BTC shot up a lot higher, it would get more likely, but still...\n\nSo we're probably not going to see anything close to $5 for quite a while. Something just short of $0.10 is also probably going to take a while, but it's not out of the realms of possibility to see it get close in the short term. $0.02 to $0.04 could totally happen overnight, but it could also go right back to $0.003.\n\nEDIT:\nTo add to this - because of the low value per Doge, a lot of people have the mistaken impression that getting in now would be like getting into BTC in 2011.  That's not the case, though.  It's more like getting into BTC at the start of 2018  which was still a really good time to get into BTC.  The only difference is that BTC is like Coca Cola, and Doge is like RC.", "created": 1609957726.0}, {"body": "You\u2019re absolutely correct.

This is designed as a store of value like gold. There is a finite and reducing supply which means that you can almost guarantee that it will be worth more in the future than it is now. Bitcoin is an investment and will increase in FIAT price. Bitcoin is DEFLATIONARY.\n\nNow, Dogecoin. This is not a store of value but is a currency designed to be used for day to day transactions a bit like the dollar. There is a constant,  increasing supply which means it will never run out but its effective value decreases over time. Think of it like this, $1 might buy a carton of milk today but in 10 years that same carton of milk might cost $2, the effective value of the dollar has decreased because you need more to purchase the same goods because there are a lot more dollars that have been printed. Like the dollar, Dogecoin is INFLATIONARY.\n\nBitcoin is the new gold but Dogecoin can be the new dollar/GPB/Euro. It doesn't need a market cap, it needs wider adoption and use. Don't hold Doge, buy and spend Doge as often as you can. This is what it is designed for and this is what will increase its FIAT value over time.", "comments": [{"body": "The inflation rate of Doge is only about 4% per year and set to go down.\n\nCryptos still have a lot of room to grow overall as adoption goes up.  The adoption rate is still very low, and if a particular coin gains popularity, it can close the gap in market cap with the others.\n\nSo it would be untrue to say that there is no chance that Doge will grow very quickly at some point, even in the short term.  It is also true, however, that $1 is a moonshot that is insanely unlikely to be attained.  \n\nDoge is just behind LTC at the moment in popularity. LTC has a market cap of about $10.2 billion. If Doge approaches that, it will be approaching $0.10. But all cryptos are likely to keep trending up; so that number gets higher.\n\nIf Doge reached the same market cap as BTC, then it would be worth about $5.92. This seems incredibly unlikely to happen given how much more popular BTC is. If BTC shot up a lot higher, it would get more likely, but still...\n\nSo we're probably not going to see anything close to $5 for quite a while. Something just short of $0.10 is also probably going to take a while, but it's not out of the realms of possibility to see it get close in the short term. $0.02 to $0.04 could totally happen overnight, but it could also go right back to $0.003.", "created": 1609859267.0}, {"body": "Doge will be the currency of great empires", "created": 1609859165.0}, {"body": "This.\n\nExcept for one little detail.\n\nBitcoin was not designed to be a value store.

Which it really isn\u2019t either.\n\nAlso, it should be pointed out that Dogecoins inflation was a lucky accident which thankfully was not fixed at the time. This is what makes us special, and a much more practical currency than anything else out there.\n\nSomething people might realise one day when Bitcoins are mined out and becoming harder and harder to find because so many have been lost.\n\nThat\u2019s probably going to be our Moon landing right there.

And I kind of wander in here to find the exact same excited yapping and despondency over lost coins that\u2019s been a fixture since day one.\n\nAnd I figured I might throw a little perspective in, by sharing a couple of my trades. My first sale, my latest sale, and one from a little while back. Enjoy...\n\n03/04/2017 21:35 Sell DOGE/AUD 10,000 0.0005946 5.946 AUD\n\nYes, 59 CENTS per thousand! And that was a handsome profit at the time too.\n\n03/01/2021 21:15 Sell DOGE/AUD 10,000 0.014877 148.77 AUD\t\n\n$14.80 per thousand is a lot healthier, eh? Especially when they were bought for less than a quarter of that. But...\n\n07/01/2018 03:33 Sell DOGE/AUD 10,000 0.020046 200.46 AUD\t\n\nThis was my peak, a couple of years ago. Twenty bucks per thousand. WooHoo!\n\nNow here\u2019s the thing.... there have been a ton of ups and downs in between those three trades. And the downs were very very down. And went on forever.\n\nSo my point is, never forget that what goes up must come down. Don\u2019t fall for all the silly hype about $1 TO THE MOON! Because that\u2019s just not gonna happen. Not now. Probably not in the foreseeable future.\n\nNot that it matters. What matters is to have your Dogecoins and keep them safe at all times. Do read the ELI5s because all this has been explained in great detail. Do check out my history, because I\u2019ve answered the same questions over and over and over and over until I got sick of it and stopped logging in.\n\nAnd also don\u2019t buy the HODL rubbish either. That\u2019s the equivalent of sticking your pay packet under the mattress, unopened. Doge is a CURRENCY. It\u2019s meant to be USED. Because that\u2019s the only way we are ever going to get to the Moon. When the utility of the coin finally overshadows the meme that everybody is so hung up on.\n\nAnd don\u2019t be afraid of selling. And buying. And selling again. Just follow a couple of simple rules...\n\n1. Never ever think it\u2019s an \u2018Investment\u2019, because it\u2019s not. Gambling, at best.\n2. Never ever spend money you can\u2019t afford to lose. Because there is nothing stopping the price falling to ZERO.\n3. Never ever sell at a loss. If you do, you crystallise your losses, and you can bet the price will spike immediately after.\n\nAnd finally, don\u2019t look for the big kill. Back in the day, my standard parcel was 100,000. Then BTC38 shut down and it just got to be more of a hassle. So I cut it to 10,000 which is pocket money. But if you buy and sell the same parcel twenty times a day and make five bucks profit on each pair, that\u2019s a hundred bucks right there. Which you can withdraw and spend, or buy more coins with. And do it again tomorrow or the next day or whenever you feel like it. At the very most, trade 10% of your holdings on the exchange. And keep most of your coins safe in your own wallets.\n\nOh, and learn everything you possibly can about how things work. Become me, or any of the other old timers. Because we all knew nothing when we started too.\n\nAnd never forget... **\u01101 = \u01101**", "comments": [{"body": "Hello Fulvio.

If you want the lowest fees, just find one of the most unpopular coins.

They have also provided extensive information on NiPoPoWs and how it is utilized in cross-chain communications.\n\nAfter approximately 3 months of reading some papers done by Dionysis Zindros of IOHK and others, I approached Charlie with my general thoughts, as well as some other members of the Litecoin Foundation.\n\nIn order to allow for good, constructive community feedback, I\u2019d like to point out a few things to help set the stage.\n\nWHAT IS A VELVET FORK?\n\n1. A \u2018Velvet Fork\u2019 is the means by which the action of adding the code will take place. It is not a hard fork, and it is also not a soft fork. Those are done through majority consensus by those with the ability to normally vote on changes to the code. A velvet fork can be done without this requirement.\n2. It will allow clients that upgrade to the new rules to still be compatible with those that do not, and adds no rule modifications to the consensus layer. In other words, Pool A decides to use the velvet fork that allows for cross-chain communications, etc., but Pool B does not. It will not affect either pool, and they can still accept each other\u2019s blocks.\n3. As far as I can tell, a velvet fork doesn\u2019t help with segregated witness (SegWit), but that is for a different second layer solution (Lightning Network) outside of this discussion.\n\nThere is always a potential issue with something called \u2018velvet mining\u2019 and \u2018selfish mining\u2019, as well as a small chance of double spending and Insidious Soft Forks. ([https://bitcoinhub.co.za/guides-what-is-a-velvet-fork/](https://bitcoinhub.co.za/guides-what-is-a-velvet-fork/))\n\n4) Velvet mining is when miners who have upgraded to the velvet blocks earn a higher reward than those who don\u2019t upgrade, more miners may not mine legacy blocks. Selfish mining is how miners may potentially find a way to \u2018hide\u2019 blocks from other miners, complete that block while others are still searching for it, then have a head start on the next block. Coindesk did an article on these two potential issues, along with other items I have provided above here: [https://www.coindesk.com/soft-hard-velvet-new-fork-promises-crypto-upgrades-without-controversy](https://www.coindesk.com/soft-hard-velvet-new-fork-promises-crypto-upgrades-without-controversy)\n\nWHAT ARE NiPoPoWs?\n\n1. NiPoPoWs is short for \u201cNon-Interactive Proofs of Work\u201d [https://nipopows.com/](https://nipopows.com/)\n2. It allows blockchains to interact like API\u2019s, enabling a cryptocurrency like Litecoin to be used within a smart contract in a blockchain that has smart contract capabilities (Ethereum, Cardano, etc.). Basically the smart contract capable blockchain validates the NiPoPow used within the Litecoin sidechain that has had the velvet fork added to allow for this action to take place.\n3. NiPoPows allow for light mobile wallets called SPV wallets. These wallets only need to download block headers, not the entire blockchain.\n4. NiPoPoWs can be added retroactively to the blockchain without miner approval, or a soft or hard fork.\n\nWHAT OTHER DOCUMENTS ARE AVAILABLE ON THE SUBJECT?\n\nDionysis and Charles were also kind enough to provide other papers that help provide a larger picture, abeit a technical one not everyone will want to read, on everything that would go into such an endeavor. They are located here:\n\nCharles Hoskinson\u2019s YouTube video\n\n[https://youtu.be/HvIAgDEUC4o](https://youtu.be/HvIAgDEUC4o)\n\nECIP\n\n[https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1046](https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org/ECIPs/ecip-1046)\n\nSeveral papers for references here:\n\n1.

An opportunity to allow for settlement payments in Litecoin in Ethereum, Cardano and other smart contract rich blockchains. This opens the door to many opportunities for a \u2018currency\u2019 focused cryptocurrency such as Litecoin.\n\nIt also opens the door to potential issues not presently plaguing the blockchain, albeit via a sidechain velvet fork.\n\nI am hoping those within the Cardano community and IOHK will also chime in with tangible, unbiased (as much as possible) questions and answers, as the benefits to their blockchain may outweigh Litecoin\u2019s.\n\nThe road to mainstream adoption is not the only thing at stake. The ability for both chains to move forward in a safe and calculated manner for their respective, individual chains should also be a part of the end goal. This ultimately isn't a miner or developer consensus decision, nor even really a Litecoin Foundation only decision, but rather one that can be decided ultimately through the questions, feedback and answers of a well educated, vibrant and global community.\n\nLet the discussion begin!", "comments": [{"body": "I think soon we may have a Cardano and Litecoin collaboration that enhances both.", "created": 1602722258.0}, {"body": "I think this would be great for Litecoin, Cardano and all cryptocurrency\u2019s.
