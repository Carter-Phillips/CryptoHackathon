If it triggers a limit sell, you can guarantee what price you will get it at, but there is a chance it won't be filled.  \n\n  \n\nCareful though, sometimes these giant candles can drop down just enough to trigger your stop loss and then the market rebounds.  Quite a few people may have just gotten a taste of that a couple of minutes ago.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs can probably be expected, there's no strategy that just always works.", "created": 1610080655.0}, {"body": "who could forget that old adage \"sell the dip\"", "created": 1610074259.0}], "created": 1610088312.0}, {"title": "Yield Machine Learning: Bridging the Gap Between A.I. and DeFi", "text": "Yield farming has become a lucrative use case for cryptocurrency holders which allows them to earn concurrent interest on their otherwise idle tokens/coins. But this doesn\u2019t come without risk. The higher the APY (annual percentage yield) for these farming and staking pools, the higher the risk exposure the holder faces.\n\nWith this risk vs. benefit problem being largely ignored, a new project called ***Yearn Machine Learning*** (***YML***) has taken on the job of protecting yield farmers by using specific parameters and multi-agent enforcement learning. The developers of ***YML*** are using *historical data and algorithms to help create models that have the capabilities to predict which yield pools have the most optimization*.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s5eu49o8hz961.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0cee7d73aad27dce97f1ec1e997f9c0f7c7dd7e\n\n***Yearn Machine Learning*** (***YML***, *Contract Address: 0xD7E48d68DCE805C97bB66B2AfFaDcdFcd47E1F95*) is an ERC20 token bringing yield farmers a new way to earn the most APY. The project is utilizing its own algorithms built by the developers that will help point holders in the right direction, meaning providing data and a solution using said data to receive the highest APY via the most efficient pools available. The developers call this process of using machine learning \u201cMulti-agent Reinforcement Learning\". One of the algorithms used to process the data needed to weigh risk vs. benefit is the ***Deterministic Policy Gradient*** (*DDPG*).\n\nThis algorithm simultaneously learns a *Q-Function* and the policy in question, in this instance the code surrounding yield farming protocols, in order for the *Q-Function* to analyze the policy in question.\n\nThese Deep Learning Reinforcement calculations create a form of artificial intelligence that can help predict which pools will provide the highest return percentage for yield farmers. The AI developed by the team at ***YML*** utilizes multiple agents that perceive the yield opportunities with sensors written in the code and acts on these opportunities with effectors. YML\u2019s code, written in C++, has recently been audited by *Solidity.Finance.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ex7rv4l9hz961.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=acbd897788f3d83b6e8f3bff8ba1dfee0527210c\n\nAll of the things ***YML*** does in the background is compacted and presented to the user in a polished dashboard which displays your ROI (*return on investment rates will be subject to change as this rate is not a permanent one as a result of the agents finding the most profitable farming pools with the least amount of risk*) along with other vital data so yield farmers can monitor their balances.\n\n***Yearn Machine Learning*** follows the distribution model outlined below:\n\n* *Max Supply\u200a\u2014\u200a30,000 YML Tokens*\n* *Circulating Supply\u200a\u2014 10,500 YML Tokens*\n* *Team Tokens\u200a\u2014\u200a1,500 YML*\n* *Marketing/Development\u200a\u2014\u200a3,000 YML Tokens*\n* *Presale Tokens\u200a\u2014\u200a3,000 YML Tokens*\n* *Uniswap Liquidity\u200a\u2014\u200a3,000 YML Tokens*\n* *Locked YML (Unicrypt)\u200a\u2014 19,500 YML Tokens*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tsjxpk59hz961.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44cfa5206c5d3345bf04ec34974064b082c761a4\n\nHolders of ***YML*** are able to benefit off of the capabilities its machine learning provides while also enjoying staking rewards when contributing to the ***YML*** ecosystem. Holders who stake their tokens will be eligible to vote on governance policies and updated procedures, giving the project a dose decentralization. Voting will be conducted off chain to avoid gas-related issues that other DAO\u2019s face by using *Snapshot* to keep voting transparent, fair, and efficient.\n\nStaking rewards received for partaking in the network are distributed via a third party contract once a set amount has been accumulated through staking. The accumulated rewards will be distributed accordingly in correspondence with reward expectations per holder. The following APY schedule is provided for staking YML:\n\n* *Daily\u200a\u2014\u200a0.11%*\n* *Monthly\u200a\u2014\u200a3.33%*\n* *Yearly\u200a\u2014\u200a40%*\n\n*It is important to note that the YML team will receive a percentage of profits due to its decentralized structure as outlined in their whitepaper.*\n\nProviding a system which creates lower risk and increased opportunities at maximizing profit can be a game changer in the DeFi realm. DeFi has exploded and expanded into one of the biggest niches of cryptocurrency, but one of its biggest and most glaring problems is the risk involved. Lowering this risk is very difficult considering the decentralized nature of most yield farming and staking platforms.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, solving this problem comes with decreased decentralization in most cases which goes against the spirit of cryptocurrency and DeFi specifically. *YML* solves this problem by using proven machine learning methods which make SeFi a safer and more sustainable place. More importantly it still provides a level of decentralization that makes token holders comfortable. Building platforms that help yield farmers through machine learning is one of the most innovative and complex ways I\u2019ve come across. Artificial Intelligence is an incredibly useful tool, and I find it quite impressive that the developers at ***YML*** have created a way to take advantage of it.\n\n***Pertinent Links***:\n\n* *Website\u200a\u2014*\u200a*https://yearnml.finance*\n* *Twitter\u200a\u2014*\u200a*https://twitter.com/yearnmlfinance*\n* *Telegram News\u200a\u2014* *https://t.me/YMLNews*\n* *Telegram Community\u200a\u2014*\u200a*https://t.me/yearnmlfinance*\n* *Discord\u200a\u2014*\u200a*https://discord.gg/YwgjTA5t9s*\n* *Etherscan\u200a\u2014*\u200a*https://etherscan.io/token/0xD7E48d68DCE805C97bB66B2AfFaDcdFcd47E1F95*\n* *YML Forum\u200a\u2014*\u200a*https://yearnml.finance/forum/*\n\n*(I write articles, reviews, and Litepapers for legitimate, interesting, up and coming cryptocurrency projects.

So why did I do it then? Because while I am balls deep in crypto, I'm not irresponsibly so. I have crypto savings goals and I have old school savings goals. This is so that if I were to lose my crypto wallet or if ETH and BTC were to go to $0 tomorrow, no matter how unlikely, I am still on track to achieve my savings goals. I don't ever want to expose myself to the risk of not having any savings and having lost the last 4 years of saving to a black hole. So what I have done is set myself an annual minimum savings goal which I must meet each year, anything I save over that goes into crypto. This savings goal is enough for me to ensure that I can get on the property ladder before my 30s and hopefully own my own property outright by my 40s or 50s. I don't want that bare minimum financial dream of mine to be dependent on crypto. If crypto fails or I lose my wallet and I didn't put anything aside then I would be well on the way to forever renting and being a wage slave for the rest of my life. I can't let there be even a slight possibility of that even if it means I won't quite make the same sick gainz as I would otherwise this bull run.\n\n**You should also ask yourself the following:**\n\n>*Is my financial future entirely dependent on crypto?*\n\nIf the answer is yes then you are probably over-invested. Make sure you have a contingency plan so that you can still achieve some bare-minimum financial goals such as paying off debts by a certain date or owning your own property one day even if crypto fails. The only exception I would make to this is if you're working a low paying job, if you're quite old and have no savings/retirement plan or if you live in a country where such goals simply aren't possible by saving the old fashioned way. If any of these are you, having all of your eggs in the crypto basket is probably ok as any other methods of achieving your bare minimum financial goals aren't possible. Just be sure to do everything you can to reduce the risk of losing your crypto or getting scammed.\n\nFinally, you may think that ETH and/or BTC going up in price is a given long term or that crypto is too big to fail now. Well I would just about agree with you. However, please consider these two things:\n\n1. There are *many* and I mean *very many* ways for you to lose your crypto. ETH doesn't have to go to zero for you to lose everything if you get hacked because you left your crypto on an exchange or because you got phished. You could get sim swapped or you could copy/paste the wrong wallet address when transferring your funds. Someone could even put a gun to your head and rob you because you openly bragged about your 32 ETH. Hackers and scammers will always have new ways to catch you off guard. Don't ever let your guard down as nobody will come to your rescue once it is too late.\n\n2. When you spend all of your spare time learning about Ethereum, browsing r/ETHTrader, reading the r/EthFinance daily, browsing crypto twitter and watching crypto YouTube, you only ever see the bullish side. You're in an echo chamber. As a result, like me, you probably underestimate the risks which could see crypto lose value in the future. So while I personally find it super unlikely that crypto will go to $0 or fade into irrelevance (especially if you have a diversified portfolio and don't only hold assets on the Ethereum blockchain), it is important to reckognise your own limitations as a human being to be able to fairly asses the probabilities of different potential outcomes. I've spent nearly 4 years in this space and what scares me is not any particular threat wiping out crypto, but it is that everything seems so bullish and crypto adoption almost seems guaranteed that I worry that my own limitations to objectively assess the probabilities of different outcomes for crypto are why crypto seems like such a sure bet. Then one day, a black swan event will come and I'll wonder why the fuck I didn't see it coming.\n\n**Relevant Resources (old posts of mine):**\n\n*Most Relevant:* [Diversification and minimising risks](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/gyas6u/diversification_is_multifaceted_what_i_have/)\n\nMy previous post on creating an exit strategy and managing risk: [Do YOU Have an Exit Strategy?

But let's make a fun thought experiment and try to imagine the domino effect as far as possible, what would happen  if USDT  loses it's peg or even becomes clear that is worth nothing or close to nothing at 15th Jan, when is the deadline for iFinex (the parent company of Tether and Bitfinex) to submit the requested documentation to NYAG (New Your Attorney General) that US authorities requested in the middle of 2019 and iFinex has been using all possible ways to delay that until now. Few fun facts to get your thinking started with:\n\n\\- They've been delaying providing those docs for 1.5 years, given that track record I find it unlikely they will provide them now, or that they will be up to satisfaction.\n\n\\- They've been ramping USDT printing exponentially in the last 6 months, $1B tether printed just the first few days of this year. For an outsider it looks like they know shit is about to hit the fan and want to buy as much unseizable crypto assets as possible before the end.\n\n\\- Market cap when they admitted they have only 76% backing in 2018 was $2B, it's $22B now \n\n\\- USDT is by far having the biggest trading volume against any crypto\n\n\\- Their last \"audit\" was in 2018 and it looked like a joke, they actually never provided proper audit of their reserves, never.\n\n\\- They always mint tether in big round number, like $800M just the other day. I find it hard to believe that deposits of investors always add-up to a round number. Look USDC mints for example, they are always like 23939394\n\n\\- Nobody seems to know where they bank right now? (Correct me if you know)\n\n\\- USDT is in lots of AMM DEX pools with other stables, if USDT loses it's peg and goes to $0, the other stable in that pool will lose it's peg to by going much above $1, so that even can single handedly cause all stables to lose their pegs\n\n\\- That will cause a lot of people that have borrowed other stables against crypto to be undercollaterized, which will liquadate their crypto collateral at market price, causing the price of that crypto to tank, cause other people to be under-collaterized and so on.....the domino is quite obvious here.\n\n\\- There is a lot of BTC on Ethereum in various forms, some of them based on collateral, that collateral might depreciate way too fast, what would happen to the BTC on ethereum?\n\n\\- nobody seems to have used [tether.to](https://tether.to) to  redeem USDT for USD?\n\n\\- a lot of exchanges rely heavily on USDT \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne train of thought seems to be everyone will pour their depreciating USDT in crypto causing the prices to go even higher, but who will take it? Well AMM LP will be the first to suffer I suppose but what happens on  CEXes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe opposite and much harder to forsee domino effect will be the doomsday scenario, all stables losing their peg, mass liquadations, halted trading at CEXes and so on, but how far could that potentially reach effect wise? How long it can last?   \nPlease try to forsee the domino effect as far as possible as a fun thought experiment.\n\nHopefully nothing will happen at 15th or at least the US government won't react harshly knowing what that would cause, but still would be better to be prepared for all possible scenarios and excersize our thinking in the process.", "comments": [{"body": "My bet is it would be extremely wild at first, but ultimately I think you would see a flight to exchanges that deal with real USD and mass selling of crypto.

Here's a quick crash course on what's been going on with Ethereum.", "text": "With the price hike, a lot of people have been returning to crypto or may be venturing in as a first time.  Here's a quick update on what's new in Ethereum:\n\n# Ethereum 2.0\n\nEthereum 2.0 phase 0 just rolled out a month ago in December.  It is the first step towards moving Ethereum to proof-of-stake.  The new chain is live and you can move ETH over to it and start staking (currently earns about 10% ROI annually). It is a one-way bridge and it does not allow for transactions yet, though, so your ETH is trapped over there if you decide to start staking. The rest of the functionality will come with phase 1 and phase 2 - and then we'll also turn off the ETH 1.0 proof-of-work chain. That's still probably a year or two away, though.\n\nMore info on staking at /r/ethstaker !\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# DeFi\n\nThe big hype in Ethereum is DeFi, or Decentralized Finance. Bitcoin famously allows you to \"be your own bank\", but really it's just you get your own bank account to hold and send money. DeFi is the rest of the bank. You can leverage, you can borrow, you can lend, you can trade, you can earn interest - all through smart contracts on Ethereum.\n\nThe biggest app on Ethereum (and is considered DeFi) is Uniswap. It's a decentralized exchange with the twist that all of the trading fees go towards liquidity providers. So you can be a trader and quickly exchange one asset for another (with a 0.3% fee) -or- you can be a supplier and let your crypto pile act as trading liquidity (and then you earn a share of the 0.3% fee as traders use it).  \n\nSome of the other big DeFi applications are SushiSwap, Yearn, Aave, Balancer, and Compound.

I don't know much about my options, but will read any good resources in depth.\n\n[Best guide I found so far](https://cryptotrader.tax/blog/defi-crypto-tax-guide) indicates that most(?) defi initially converts my ETH into some other token, which is a capital gains realization at the time of the conversion. This is what I want to avoid, because I can only cover so much cap gains tax without cashing out some crypto, which I don't want to do!\n\nSo I guess I am asking what the current best options are to put my ETH to work earning some additional $/ETH/other tokens, **without converting the ETH to something else.** \n\nMy priorities in order:\n\n1.

It triggers capital gains on the way in or it doesn't.  There is no official guidance, so you've got to kind of pick one, but also prepare for the other in case something retroactive occurs.  Most everyone agrees that interest earned counts as income, though it can be tricky to calculate given the moving price targets.\n\nETH 2.0 staking is a way to earn some interest on your ETH, but that has its own problems (counts as earning income, but you can't sell the asset that you are earning because it's locked).\n\nBasically it's all a cluster because the IRS still lives in 1980.

Help!", "text": "Good morning, ETH hodlers! I want to learn more about DAPPS, DeFi, and the Ethereum blockchain. Where is a good place to start?", "comments": [{"body": "**On Ethereum:**\n\nAt its core, Ethereum does basically everything Bitcoin does but with the addition of smart contracts. Smart contracts are little chunks of code that run without any central operator or middleman.\n\nThe ELI5 example I like to give is imagine you and I are making a $10 bet on whether the Chiefs are going to win the super bowl this year. In the normal world, we either trust each other to pay up at the end, or we each give our $10 to someone to hold the money and act as an intermediary (and a lot of intermediaries charge fees for this kind of service and make big money). With Ethereum, though, we can actually give our $10 to a smart contract and then the smart contract can automatically pay out the pot to the winner, according to its code.\n\nSmart contracts can essentially remove intermediaries, whether they be in gambling, banking, or anything else. It gets way more intense and complex when you get into the details, but that's the high level picture of why smart contracts are awesome and powerful.\n\n`-----------------------------------`\n\n**On DeFi & dApps:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like to start with Uniswap, which is the biggest decentralized exchange on Ethereum. It is a monster, often accounting for 50% of activity on Ethereum and often generating more fees than the entirety of Bitcoin.\n\nLike any exchange, people can exchange one asset for another, and basically any asset running on Ethereum can be found on Uniswap.  (even ethtrader's donuts)\n\nThe novel thing about Uniswap is who the trading fees go to.  Think about how trading fees work on something like Coinbase.  You buy ETH, and Coinbase takes a small percentage for themselves.  On Uniswap, there is no middleman... no Coinbase gobbling up all the trading fees.  The trading fees instead go to the people that supply liquidity.\n\nAnd anyone can be a liquidity provider.  You, me, or your grandma.  Providers basically deposit money into Uniswap to facilitate trades. When people make trades on the platform, the trading fee is distributed across all of the liquidity providers, rather than going to Uniswap or its creators.\n\nSo an example: look at the Tether and Ethereum (USDT-ETH) pool. Alice is our liquidity provider and she comes along and deposits $1,000 worth of USDT and $1,000 worth of ETH into the liquidity pool. Bob is our trader, and he comes along to Uniswap and exchanges $100 worth of USDT for $99.70 worth of ETH. The missing 30 cents goes to Alice as a trading fee. Alice's holdings in the pool would also shift - she now has about $1,100.15 worth of USDT and $900.15 worth of ETH.\n\nThat's the basics. In reality, there's thousands of liquidity providers in that pool and Bob's trading fee gets distributed across all the liquidity providers, based off how much value they deposited. \n\nThe returns on a pool like this are pretty good (about 20%-30% per year), but obviously there are some unique risks and the ROI is not constant. If ETH price takes off, your share of the pool shifts to more USDT and less ETH. If ETH price tanks, you end up with lots more ETH and lots less USDT. Also, the returns are directly related to trading volume. You're essentially selling shovels in the gold rush as a liquidity provider. If no one is gold rushing, no one is buying shovels. Your returns also depend on how many other people are selling shovels. There is also risk with the smart contract security itself, though Uniswap is pretty battle tested by this point.\n\n`-----------------------------------`\n\nLemme know if you have any questions, will definitely try to answer.", "created": 1609877486.0}], "created": 1609895435.0}, {"title": "Why the volatility?", "text": "\nI\u2019m sure there\u2019s no simple answer, but why is there so much volatility in crypto?

And it is going to $200 in the coming alt-season, in my humble opinion.\n\nUniswap's daily volume yesterday crossed $1 billion, not for the first time but it looks like it will sustain at such levels in coming days, weeks and months as ETH has crossed $1000 without much hype and with much criticism. Liquidity is over $2.7 billion, even when there are no incentives.\n\nInstitutional liquidity is flowing into Bitcoin and it will soon flow into Eth too. Eth will get it\u2019s CME futures, the OCC has given banks a go ahead for launching stablecoins on public blockchains and Ethereum has the ecosystem and toolset ready for everything that is about to come. After Bitcoin & Eth, DeFi governance tokens will be tokens people would want to hodl. And in that, the top ones. And when the HNIs & institutions (non crypto-native ones) start looking into DeFi, the first thing they\u2019d come to know about is the likes of UNI, Comp, etc., the products which are not much difficult to understand and have good reputation and are decentralized. By the time this happens, Uniswap will also likely be on Optimism with the cash-flow switch turned on. With the interest rates close to zero and negative, P/E ratios can virtually be infinite. That\u2019s another point to add to the value proposition. And don\u2019t forget Uniswap v3.\n\nBesides this, Uniswap is deeply integrated into the DeFi ecosystem and all the projects. MakerDAO now accepts Uniswap LP tokens for minting Dai. And also, think about this as betting on the Uniswap team. We know what the team is capable of and we know they\u2019re highly competent and innovation won\u2019t stop at v3. \n\nAt $200, Uniswap's fully diluted valuation will be $200 billion. So, really, am I being stupid here? Nope. $200 UNI will happen when BTC is above $100k, ETH is over $10k. When we're back to a Jan 2018 type of scenario. I'm not saying that it's an 'if', but a 'when'. Cardano, for context was trading at a fully diluted value of $40 billion in last cycle's alt-season, without any product or users, pure hype.\n\nAnd of course, $200 won\u2019t be sustainable for the next couple of years at least, but we are early. Even crypto people from 2017 don\u2019t want to hold crypto tokens for a few months. They just want to flip and most end up burning their ETH & BTC. Just by buying now and holding patiently would be rewarding imo.\n\nUNI is between $5 and $5.50 now and I\u2019m putting this out here that UNI is going to $200 in the coming alt-season.\n\nThe \"major\" competitor to Uniswap is Sushiswap, but at the end of the day, Sushiswap is just a fork project. They can add new features, refresh their front-end and blah blah but it is what it is- a fork. Sushiswap has volume and liquidity right now only because of its ongoing liquidity incentives. And Uniswap doesn't have it going right now. Look at what happened to Swerve (the Curve fork)- I think that is what will ultimately happen to Sushiswap. Sure, Sushiswap is now a part of Yearn Finance but you don't see new projects providing liquidity for their projects on Sushiswap, you don't see projects celebrating Sushiswap listings. Uniswap is the king in the DEX space.\n\nBalancer and other such tweaked and more innovative AMMs are good but the volume and liquidity on Uniswap speaks for itself.\n\nThe high gas fees problem- retail can't use it. Uniswap has shown us already that it can work well on Optimistic Rollups. And Optimism is starting their launch this month. In a few months, this won't be a problem and so we don't have to worry about AMM volumes being drained away to other blockchains.\n\nSo what I'm saying is, SEND IT!!!\n\nAnd above all, do your own research. This is not financial advice. Don\u2019t buy UNI just because I said so. Think for yourself. I'm not responsible for your losses or profits.\n\nI would love to hear what you all think about this :)", "comments": [{"body": "Best place to buy UNI?

It works by people inserting \"liquidity\" into a pool of assets that is used to facilitate trades. So it's really just a smart contract running on Ethereum. When people make trades on the platform, the trading fee is distributed across all of the liquidity providers.\n\nSo an example: look at the Tether and Ethereum (USDT-ETH) pool. Alice comes along and deposits $1,000 worth of USDT and $1,000 worth of ETH into the liquidity pool. Bob then comes along to Uniswap and exchanges $100 worth of USDT for $99.70 worth of ETH. The missing 30 cents goes to Alice as a trading fee. Alice's holdings in the pool would also shift - she now has about $1,100.15 worth of USDT and $900.15 worth of ETH.\n\nThat's the basics. In reality, there's thousands of liquidity providers in that pool and Bob's trading fee gets distributed across all the liquidity providers, based off how much value they deposited. This number of users also dampens the blow to Alice's balance between USDT and ETH in the pool.\n\nThe returns on a pool like this are pretty good, about 20%-30% per year, but obviously there are some unique risks. If ETH price takes off, your share of the pool shifts to more USDT and less ETH. If ETH price tanks, you end up with lots more ETH and lots less USDT. Also, the returns are directly related to trading volume. You're essentially selling shovels in the gold rush as a liquidity provider. If no one is gold rushing, no one is buying shovels. Your returns also depend on how many other people are selling shovels. There is also risk with the smart contract security itself, though Uniswap is pretty battle tested by this point, handling billions of dollars worth of crypto.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know if you have specific questions!", "created": 1609733456.0}, {"body": "Welcome back!

The idea originates from the Austrian School of Economics, in more specific work of Ludwig von Mises. $VLO is first of its kind, giving the first mover advance going forward. \n\n$VLO is community governed DAO, with very low market cap of 300k, and at accumulation stage. The project is under radar, but attracting more and more new stakeholders. It is a matter of time when people understand the concept and actually see the transformational power it carries. Significant marketing, BSC integration for growth and project X that implements the principles to other currencies are on their way. \n\n$VLO is build around a question of value, what it is, and how it is measured.\nVelocity of circulation of a currency has a direct impact on the value of the same currency in an economy; the velocity of circulation cannot be separated and it is a key aspect of present and future value.\n\n$VLO implements high mathematical formulas to the token economics\nIf there is no velocity for a currency, no usage, it cannot be very valuable. Unlike other rebase projects, VLO does not rebase on any price peg. For this there is a simple reason: it restricts the token value. Value can be only created on free markets and be based on free will, not determined by any outside factor. VLO protocol is expressing the value by measuring the velocity, which makes it totally unique defi protocol. \n\n$VLO tokeneconomics are very clever; the more there is velocity, the more the supply goes down, making it more prone to value appreciation. The rebase function reduces the supply, but at the same time it adjusts the price and the token holders own all the time the same % of the total supply. In addition, LP providers are incentived to provide liquidity, getting velocity based rewards. \n\nRead more about velocity in Medium blog: \n\n[https://link.medium.com/gxoImezdKcb](https://link.medium.com/gxoImezdKcb)\n\nWhite paper is available at GitHub: [https://github.com/velo-finance/velo-protocol/blob/master/VELO_Whitepaper_v1.1.pdf](https://github.com/velo-finance/velo-protocol/blob/master/VELO_Whitepaper_v1.1.pdf)\n\nThe project has been audited with full pass:\n\n[https://solidity.finance/audits/VELO/](https://solidity.finance/audits/VELO/)\n\nWebsite: \n[https://velotoken.fi](https://velotoken.fi)\n\nTG: \n[https://t.me/Velotoken](https://t.me/Velotoken)\n\nVLO welcomes you to join the movement and create a paradigm shift towards economies of real value, withouth centralized authority.", "comments": [], "created": 1609707492.0}, {"title": "Ethereum @ $832 on Coinbase Pro", "text": "It's a slippery slope to $1,000!

(You could also say ETH is used for speculation purposes but let's leave that aside for now).\n* Ethereum right now has a hard transaction throughput limit at 15 transactions / second. We've already hit this limit.\n* We also know there is a [12.5 MM gas limit](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/69053/ethereum-miners-vote-for-25-gas-limit-increase) per Ethereum block created.\n* Since the ability to process Ethereum transactions is, for now, now a scarce good (capped at 15 tx / sec) AND there is a gas limit per block created, users are forced to pay higher and higher gas and ETH prices (as measured in USD $) if they want their transaction to be processed. **This is one of two fundamental drivers of Ethereum's price (the other one being speculation).**\n\nDoes this mean that:\n\n* When Ethereum 2.0 is released in 2022, Ethereum network can handle [100,000 tx / sec](https://www.coindesk.com/sharding-eth-2-podcast) thanks to new sharding capabilities.\n* **Since network throughput has increased, and the sole utility of ETH is to incentivize users to process your transaction** (setting aside speculation and holding ETH in order to be able to participate in proof-of-stake)**, does this mean that Ethereum's price is bound to fall?

Each pool is an index that periodically updates its weights and tokens to better represent a market sector, such as defi or crypto generally, and is a high-fee AMM capable of generating revenue beyond the growth of the underlying assets.\n\nIndex tokens allow you to hold a single token which represents the top tokens in a market sector, and to easily manage your exposure to a market without needing to constantly manage your portfolio or research each tracked asset. Their prices also serve as benchmarks of general market performance that can be used to assess other investments.\n\n\nWhat's DEFI5?\n\nDEFI5 is a tokenized, passively managed index that tracks the top 5 DeFi tokens by market cap. The index autonomously updates its weights and tokens held using preset rules and on-chain market data. The value of the index is entirely determined by the value of the underlying assets, which are held by the portfolio in amounts proportional to their weights. There are no management fees, and DEFI5 tokens can be minted, burned or traded on demand to easily manage your exposure to the DeFi market.\n\n\nHow do you select tokens?\n\nTokens are selected automatically and weighted by market cap for the index from a DAO voted whitelist that meet the requirements for the category DEFI5 \n\n- The token is at least a week old.\n- No major vulnerabilities have been discovered in the token contract.\n- The token's supply can not be arbitrarily inflated or deflated maliciously and there are no transfer fees or other non-standard balance updates.\n- The token meets the requirements of the ERC20 standard.\n- The token has a fully diluted market cap of at least $50 million.\n- At least $1 million worth of liquidity is locked in the Uniswap market pair between the token and WETH.\n-The token is a protocol or governance token for a DeFi project.\n\n\nRebalances and Reweighs\n\nThe weights are updated every 7d and every 4 reweighs a Rebalance can be triggered to update the underlying tokens for the index from the categories above.\nThe actual token weights and balances gradually move toward the targets set by the reweighs and reindexes to minimize loss of funds from arbitrage.\n\n\nMinting and Burning\n\nNew index tokens can be minted by providing all the underlying tokens according to their weights. We created a uniswap auto minter which automatically purchases all the needed tokens and mints through uniswap. Index tokens can be burned to retrieve the underlying assets in proportion to the number of tokens burned, are fully collateralized at all times, and their value is based only on the value of the underlying assets.\n\n\nLink\n\nhttps://indexed.Finance", "comments": [], "created": 1609616929.0}, {"title": "Ethereum's value", "text": "How about next internet worth? \nBitcoin changes concept digital cash for digital gold.

I'm also actively mining the coin, as I believe in the tech behind it and want to support the network (and earn some XMR on the side).\n\nCurrently I have 100% of my veeeery small portfolio in BTC for obvious reasons. I'm considering buying into XMR and want to know if I'd be making a safe long-term investment. The Monero subs at r/monero and r/xmrtrading can be echo-chambers, so I figured I'd come here for some correction and less-biased opinions.\n\nMonero has been involved in many different events lately:  \n- Unknown attackers have attempted to compromise the Monero network, unsuccessfully.  \n- Monero was recently delisted from many exchanges.  \n- The French are introducing a new law that effectively bans Monero usage.  \n- Lots of darknet markets are abandoning Bitcoin in favor of Monero, with many requiring Monero usage.\n\nThe Monero community sees these events as validation that their tech works. They have successfully withstood the network attacks with little consequence, governments trying to complicate or ban XMR usage seems to be them admitting they can't trace the currency, and darknet markets who require privacy to elude law enforcement are migrating en masse to Monero. This last one is particularly important; the Monero community notes that Bitcoin first gained popularity in the dark net, and then spread outwards from there.\n\nThe Monero community claims that XMR is the \"true\" Bitcoin that Satoshi advocated for in their original paper. I don't know if I agree with this sentiment, but I think it's certainly impossible to argue against Monero's suitability as a truly private cryptocurrency.\n\nI personally have two reasons to believe that Monero could soon become a major player in the crypto market:  \n- In the near future: [Atomic swaps between BTC/XMR are under development.](https://amp.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/ilyv9u/atomic_swap_implementation_supporting_monero/) Once complete, they will allow for easy switching between BTC & XMR that's secure, decentralized, and anonymous. This will render BTC/XMR exchanges obsolete.  \n- In the farther future: [Monero is researching hardening their network against quantum attackers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/kcl547/ama_research_team_analyzing_the_implications_of/?utm_source=amp&utm_medium=&utm_content=post_body) Quantum computers may be able to undo the algorithms all cryptocurrencies rely on for security. Monero seems to be unique among all coins in their active efforts to quantum-proof their blockchain and preserve privacy & security in the face of a powerful quantum attacker.\n\nNow this is all fine and dandy, and frankly the tech is incredible. But how does it translate to adoption of Monero as a real currency and increasing its value?\n\nThis is why I'm here. Knowing all this, how do all of you believe Monero will fare in the short- and long-term? Do you think that Monero could have what it takes to stand alongside Bitcoin as a viable replacement for fiat currencies? Will I see a return by HODLing Monero?", "comments": [{"body": "I thought I read somewhere recently a few exchanges have removed them but I might be wrong", "created": 1610147287.0}, {"body": "Can\u2019t hurt to have a small percent in Monero but I would keep a majority with BTC and ETH.

Stop trying to second guess what others may do, and think more about what **you** want to achieve. If you really are looking for financial privacy then f\\* the regulators, it's nobody's business but yours.\n\nMonero is not \"the true bitcoin\", the code is very different. I can't speak too much about it as I've never used it and I have little interest in it. The developers come across as bright people but the communities are stupidly toxic.\n\nIn it's past, monero was retroactively cracked, revealing at least 20% of transactions. Probably it's better now but it goes to show the nature of the beast, it's always going to be a moving target.\n\nYou also need to keep in mind that the auditing of the chain and having privacy creates a conflict. If, say, an inflation bug occurs, you may never know about those extra coins. Just a few years ago, bitcoin had a near death experience when a (yet another) infinite inflation bug was discovered... and that's a chain with clear auditing and the world's eyes on it! Can you imagine the added difficulty that poses for privacy coins?\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/the-latest-bitcoin-bug-was-so-bad-developers-kept-its-full-details-a-secret](https://www.coindesk.com/the-latest-bitcoin-bug-was-so-bad-developers-kept-its-full-details-a-secret)\n\nHaving said that, on balance, I prefer privacy coins. Just keep in mind, different strokes for different folks.\n\nThe most interesting privacy coins are based on MimbleWimble, which is very elegant in design. Individual transactions are never stored on chain, boosting both privacy and efficiency at the same time. However, most of the work to identify users is not done on chain, but rather through behavioral analysis or targeted attacks. Let's not forget how Tails OS was compromised.\n\nRegarding atomic swaps, while they are very helpful, liquidity can be a problem.

Few fun facts to get your thinking started with:\n\n\\- They've been delaying providing those docs for 1.5 years, given that track record I find it unlikely they will provide them now, or that they will be up to satisfaction.\n\n\\- They've been ramping USDT printing exponentially in the last 6 months, $1B tether printed just the first few days of this year. For an outsider it looks like they know shit is about to hit the fan and want to buy as much unseizable crypto assets as possible before the end.\n\n\\- Market cap when they admitted they have only 76% backing in 2018 was $2B, it's $22B now \n\n\\- USDT is by far having the biggest trading volume against any crypto\n\n\\- Their last \"audit\" was in 2018 and it looked like a joke, they actually never provided proper audit of their reserves, never.\n\n\\- They always mint tether in big round number, like $800M just the other day. I find it hard to believe that deposits of investors always add-up to a round number. Look USDC mints for example, they are always like 23939394\n\n\\- Nobody seems to know where they bank right now? (Correct me if you know)\n\n\\- USDT is in lots of AMM DEX pools with other stables, if USDT loses it's peg and goes to $0, the other stable in that pool will lose it's peg to by going much above $1, so that even can single handedly cause all stables to lose their pegs\n\n\\- That will cause a lot of people that have borrowed other stables against crypto to be undercollaterized, which will liquadate their crypto collateral at market price, causing the price of that crypto to tank, cause other people to be under-collaterized and so on.....the domino is quite obvious here.\n\n\\- There is a lot of BTC on Ethereum in various forms, some of them based on collateral, that collateral might depreciate way too fast, what would happen to the BTC on ethereum?\n\n\\- nobody seems to have used [tether.to](https://tether.to) to  redeem USDT for USD?\n\n\\- a lot of exchanges rely heavily on USDT \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne train of thought seems to be everyone will pour their depreciating USDT in crypto causing the prices to go even higher, but who will take it? Well AMM LP will be the first to suffer I suppose but what happens on  CEXes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe opposite and much harder to forsee domino effect will be the doomsday scenario, all stables losing their peg, mass liquadations, halted trading at CEXes and so on, but how far could that potentially reach effect wise?

The senator, reportedly said, \"If we reach the point where we have overspent so much that things start crashing down, the black swan event occurs with any regard to any fiat currency...there is a backstop available to every government in the world and that backstop is bitcoin,\" Lummis said.  \n\nThe senator-elect also said that bitcoin is a better store of value than paper money because the cryptocurrency's supply is finite. Bitcoin is indeed the currency of the 21st century, gone is the era of plastic money which has several flaws (e.g. being centralized and traceable). The Blockchain has several innovative dapps like online decentralized casino, [EarnBet](https://play.earnbet.io/) which seeks to overthrow traditional casinos, Chain-link which has untamperable oracle services, and best of all, Ethereum which allows developers to create an app using its technology. Recently, even Coca-Cola expressed an interest in using its mainnet, showing its untapped potential and massive application.  \n\nLastly, bitcoin is inflation-proof and there is a direct correlation between an economy's inflation and the use of cryptocurrencies. For example, a decent population of Venezuela uses cryptocurrencies as they have finally realized how 'redundant' fiat is and inflation can distort is function of acting as money, i.e. serving as a store of value.

I'm not looking for any miracles but rather I have some savings that I want to put into crypto and leave there for a few years out of curiosity.\n\nAfter months of reading I do believe I have the most basic knowledge needed to create a portfolio with regard to proportions and coins to buy etc, however given the current price of BTC is it a bad time to be investing roughly 1k in it? (Which is a large sum of money to me, but isn't going to break the bank.) I had intended on BTC forming around 60% of my portfolio so I feel like timing is of course important.
