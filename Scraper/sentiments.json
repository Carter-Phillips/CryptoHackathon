You could get sim swapped or you could copy/paste the wrong wallet address when transferring your funds.

Here's a quick crash course on what's been going on with Ethereum. With the price hike, a lot of people have been returning to crypto or may be venturing in as a first time.  Here's a quick update on what's new in Ethereum:\n\n# Ethereum 2.0\n\nEthereum 2.0 phase 0 just rolled out a month ago in December.  It is the first step towards moving Ethereum to proof-of-stake.  The new chain is live and you can move ETH over to it and start staking (currently earns about 10% ROI annually). It is a one-way bridge and it does not allow for transactions yet, though, so your ETH is trapped over there if you decide to start staking. The rest of the functionality will come with phase 1 and phase 2 - and then we'll also turn off the ETH 1.0 proof-of-work chain. That's still probably a year or two away, though.\n\nMore info on staking at /r/ethstaker !\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# DeFi\n\nThe big hype in Ethereum is DeFi, or Decentralized Finance. Bitcoin famously allows you to \"be your own bank\", but really it's just you get your own bank account to hold and send money. DeFi is the rest of the bank. You can leverage, you can borrow, you can lend, you can trade, you can earn interest - all through smart contracts on Ethereum.\n\nThe biggest app on Ethereum (and is considered DeFi) is Uniswap. It's a decentralized exchange with the twist that all of the trading fees go towards liquidity providers. So you can be a trader and quickly exchange one asset for another (with a 0.3% fee) -or- you can be a supplier and let your crypto pile act as trading liquidity (and then you earn a share of the 0.3% fee as traders use it).  \n\nSome of the other big DeFi applications are SushiSwap, Yearn, Aave, Balancer, and Compound.  Each has its own unique quirks and intricacies. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Adoption & Transaction Fees\n\nUniswap, by itself, often earns more daily transaction fees than the entirety of Bitcoin. Ethereum usually does 3x-4x the transaction fees of Bitcoin on a daily basis.\n\nPeople are really using Ethereum, which is great, but the crazy demand on Ethereum is making transaction fees extremely high.   Daily transactions have been sustained at the old peak for the last 6 months:\n\n[https://etherscan.io/chart/tx](https://etherscan.io/chart/tx)\n\nA number of layer 2 solutions are in the works (and several are already available) to try and decrease the gas demand.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWelcome back to crypto!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh, also, we have donuts now on [r/ethtrader](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/)! As long as you register on the mainpage, you get paid tokens to essentially hang out on Reddit (which you can actually exchange for ETH) which is a pretty crazy concept.

Lowest I could buy in would be 250USD and I would be commissioned to promote the sale of ETH as well as bring in new sales. I said no.

Hello. Im a noob on broader market finance and regulations and this is speculation at best but am curious what others may think.\n\nHypothetically, say a group or \"cartel\" of whales holding ETH pump the price to say $3K or something leading to the Feb 8th release of ETH Futures, then also coordinate to create contracts on the 8th with unbeknownst buyers to enter futures contracts agreeing to sell amounts of ETH at lets say $1k. Given the current $3K spot value of ETH this looks attractive (because what are the chances it will crash that much in 6 months?). However, the cartel then proceeds to continually dump its bags crashing the price and suppressing to lets say $500 until the futures contracts expires, essentially making a 100% profit on the $500 spot price of ETH by selling it to suckers who agreed to buy at $1k.   \n\n\nWe all know BTC price crashed after futures release, do you think this the type of manipulation caused it?  Does the CFTC monitor or protect against this type of manipulation in anyway?

Smart contracts are little chunks of code that run without any central operator or middleman.\n\nThe ELI5 example I like to give is imagine you and I are making a $10 bet on whether the Chiefs are going to win the super bowl this year. In the normal world, we either trust each other to pay up at the end, or we each give our $10 to someone to hold the money and act as an intermediary (and a lot of intermediaries charge fees for this kind of service and make big money). With Ethereum, though, we can actually give our $10 to a smart contract and then the smart contract can automatically pay out the pot to the winner, according to its code.\n\nSmart contracts can essentially remove intermediaries, whether they be in gambling, banking, or anything else. It gets way more intense and complex when you get into the details, but that's the high level picture of why smart contracts are awesome and powerful.\n\n`-----------------------------------`\n\n**On DeFi & dApps:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI like to start with Uniswap, which is the biggest decentralized exchange on Ethereum.

(even ethtrader's donuts)\n\nThe novel thing about Uniswap is who the trading fees go to.  Think about how trading fees work on something like Coinbase.  You buy ETH, and Coinbase takes a small percentage for themselves.  On Uniswap, there is no middleman... no Coinbase gobbling up all the trading fees.  The trading fees instead go to the people that supply liquidity.\n\nAnd anyone can be a liquidity provider.  You, me, or your grandma.  Providers basically deposit money into Uniswap to facilitate trades. When people make trades on the platform, the trading fee is distributed across all of the liquidity providers, rather than going to Uniswap or its creators.\n\nSo an example: look at the Tether and Ethereum (USDT-ETH) pool. Alice is our liquidity provider and she comes along and deposits $1,000 worth of USDT and $1,000 worth of ETH into the liquidity pool. Bob is our trader, and he comes along to Uniswap and exchanges $100 worth of USDT for $99.70 worth of ETH. The missing 30 cents goes to Alice as a trading fee. Alice's holdings in the pool would also shift - she now has about $1,100.15 worth of USDT and $900.15 worth of ETH.\n\nThat's the basics. In reality, there's thousands of liquidity providers in that pool and Bob's trading fee gets distributed across all the liquidity providers, based off how much value they deposited. \n\nThe returns on a pool like this are pretty good (about 20%-30% per year), but obviously there are some unique risks and the ROI is not constant. If ETH price takes off, your share of the pool shifts to more USDT and less ETH. If ETH price tanks, you end up with lots more ETH and lots less USDT. Also, the returns are directly related to trading volume. You're essentially selling shovels in the gold rush as a liquidity provider. If no one is gold rushing, no one is buying shovels. Your returns also depend on how many other people are selling shovels.

Its essentially been treated as a safe haven.\n\nHistorically Safe havens don't last very long and  institutions are more of a mix between profit maximisers and hodlers of various assets.\n\nIn the 70s gold and silver saw impressive rallies due to runaway inflation. These rallies were fueled mostly by institutions and big players. However the prices of assets crashed soon after.\n\nSince the USA government managed to get a hold of things by raising intrest rates to 20%. \n\n2011 saw another impressive gold and silver rally due to  US hesitation to raise the debt ceiling. Usually raising the debt ceiling happens automatically and quickly. There was a real possibility that the USA wouldn't be able to pay its debts.\n\nOnce the US raised the debt ceiling safe havens such as Gold and Silver tanked.\n\nWho remembers ww3? When Trump assassinated Soleimani?\n\nPanic ensued and people thought a USA-Iran war would lead to a world war though other global powers siding with Iran.\n\nDuring this this time Bitcoin had a impressive rally, however cooler heads managed to prevail and the crisis was averted.\n\nWould have bitcoin continued rise without covid 19? unlikely due to assets such as oil dropped after ww3 was averted.\n\nFinally we have Covid 19 where bitcoin crashed with the rest of the financial markets. The crash was so great there weren't any buy orders on exchange order books.\n\nIronically Bitcoin and other financial markets were saved by the federal reserve. The very thing the crypto community despises. If they didn't print money this rally would be impossible.\n\nI can confidently say we would see a multi year bear market in every financial asset, if money wasn't printed.\n\nIf Bitcoin was a safe haven why did it tank?\n\nMoving forward today, the global governments are in crisis, however I doubt it will last long because we have had major crisises before and things have recovered just fine.\n\nIf bitcoin is a safe haven, I think it will tank if and when things go back to normal. Just like any other safe haven in history.\n\nAnyhow everyone in the crypto community should be thanking and kissing the feet of the federal reserve.

Full disclosure: I have done a shit ton of research into \"privacy coins\" like Dash and Zcash, and have found Monero to be the only truly private coin. I'm also actively mining the coin, as I believe in the tech behind it and want to support the network (and earn some XMR on the side).\n\nCurrently I have 100% of my veeeery small portfolio in BTC for obvious reasons. I'm considering buying into XMR and want to know if I'd be making a safe long-term investment. The Monero subs at r/monero and r/xmrtrading can be echo-chambers, so I figured I'd come here for some correction and less-biased opinions.\n\nMonero has been involved in many different events lately:  \n- Unknown attackers have attempted to compromise the Monero network, unsuccessfully.  \n- Monero was recently delisted from many exchanges.  \n- The French are introducing a new law that effectively bans Monero usage.  \n- Lots of darknet markets are abandoning Bitcoin in favor of Monero, with many requiring Monero usage.\n\nThe Monero community sees these events as validation that their tech works. They have successfully withstood the network attacks with little consequence, governments trying to complicate or ban XMR usage seems to be them admitting they can't trace the currency, and darknet markets who require privacy to elude law enforcement are migrating en masse to Monero. This last one is particularly important; the Monero community notes that Bitcoin first gained popularity in the dark net, and then spread outwards from there.\n\nThe Monero community claims that XMR is the \"true\" Bitcoin that Satoshi advocated for in their original paper. I don't know if I agree with this sentiment, but I think it's certainly impossible to argue against Monero's suitability as a truly private cryptocurrency.\n\nI personally have two reasons to believe that Monero could soon become a major player in the crypto market:  \n- In the near future: [Atomic swaps between BTC/XMR are under development.](https://amp.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/ilyv9u/atomic_swap_implementation_supporting_monero/) Once complete, they will allow for easy switching between BTC & XMR that's secure, decentralized, and anonymous. This will render BTC/XMR exchanges obsolete.  \n- In the farther future: [Monero is researching hardening their network against quantum attackers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/kcl547/ama_research_team_analyzing_the_implications_of/?utm_source=amp&utm_medium=&utm_content=post_body) Quantum computers may be able to undo the algorithms all cryptocurrencies rely on for security. Monero seems to be unique among all coins in their active efforts to quantum-proof their blockchain and preserve privacy & security in the face of a powerful quantum attacker.\n\nNow this is all fine and dandy, and frankly the tech is incredible. But how does it translate to adoption of Monero as a real currency and increasing its value?\n\nThis is why I'm here. Knowing all this, how do all of you believe Monero will fare in the short- and long-term? Do you think that Monero could have what it takes to stand alongside Bitcoin as a viable replacement for fiat currencies? Will I see a return by HODLing Monero?"}, {"coin": "Bitcoin", "sentiment": 0.20000000298023224, "created": 1610169953.0, "text": "Can\u2019t hurt to have a small percent in Monero but I would keep a majority with BTC and ETH.

You're also highlighting crypto regulations but why on earth would you care about some guy you've never met, telling you what you can or can't do with your own 0's and 1's? Stop trying to second guess what others may do, and think more about what **you** want to achieve. If you really are looking for financial privacy then f\\* the regulators, it's nobody's business but yours.\n\nMonero is not \"the true bitcoin\", the code is very different. I can't speak too much about it as I've never used it and I have little interest in it. The developers come across as bright people but the communities are stupidly toxic.\n\nIn it's past, monero was retroactively cracked, revealing at least 20% of transactions. Probably it's better now but it goes to show the nature of the beast, it's always going to be a moving target.\n\nYou also need to keep in mind that the auditing of the chain and having privacy creates a conflict. If, say, an inflation bug occurs, you may never know about those extra coins. Just a few years ago, bitcoin had a near death experience when a (yet another) infinite inflation bug was discovered... and that's a chain with clear auditing and the world's eyes on it! Can you imagine the added difficulty that poses for privacy coins?\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/the-latest-bitcoin-bug-was-so-bad-developers-kept-its-full-details-a-secret](https://www.coindesk.com/the-latest-bitcoin-bug-was-so-bad-developers-kept-its-full-details-a-secret)\n\nHaving said that, on balance, I prefer privacy coins. Just keep in mind, different strokes for different folks.\n\nThe most interesting privacy coins are based on MimbleWimble, which is very elegant in design. Individual transactions are never stored on chain, boosting both privacy and efficiency at the same time. However, most of the work to identify users is not done on chain, but rather through behavioral analysis or targeted attacks. Let's not forget how Tails OS was compromised.\n\nRegarding atomic swaps, while they are very helpful, liquidity can be a problem. There are more advanced models for solving this."}, {"coin": "Ethereum", "sentiment": 0.20000000298023224, "created": 1610105888.0, "text": "Are Cryptocurrencies a Good Store Of Value?

An incoming Senator believes bitcoin is a better store of value than paper money and plans to teach Congress how to use it to reduce the national debt.  \n\nSenator-elect Cynthia Lummis told the What Bitcoin Did podcast that bitcoin is a better store of value than paper money and she plans to teach Congress how to use it to reduce the national debt when she assumes office in January. The senator, reportedly said, \"If we reach the point where we have overspent so much that things start crashing down, the black swan event occurs with any regard to any fiat currency...there is a backstop available to every government in the world and that backstop is bitcoin,\" Lummis said.  \n\nThe senator-elect also said that bitcoin is a better store of value than paper money because the cryptocurrency's supply is finite. Bitcoin is indeed the currency of the 21st century, gone is the era of plastic money which has several flaws (e.g. being centralized and traceable). The Blockchain has several innovative dapps like online decentralized casino, [EarnBet](https://play.earnbet.io/) which seeks to overthrow traditional casinos, Chain-link which has untamperable oracle services, and best of all, Ethereum which allows developers to create an app using its technology. Recently, even Coca-Cola expressed an interest in using its mainnet, showing its untapped potential and massive application.  \n\nLastly, bitcoin is inflation-proof and there is a direct correlation between an economy's inflation and the use of cryptocurrencies. For example, a decent population of Venezuela uses cryptocurrencies as they have finally realized how 'redundant' fiat is and inflation can distort is function of acting as money, i.e. serving as a store of value.

I get it that BCH is cheaper to transact with than BTC (or possibly LTC) on the base layer. I don't doubt that. But I keep hearing how fast BCH is when in fact it has the same 10 minute block confirmation time as BTC. Thus it is not faster, it's just cheaper. \n\nMy conclusion is that if someone wants faster and cheaper transactions on the first layer, then they could use LTC since it has \\~2.5m confirmation time (although it tends to orphan blocks more often because of that).\n\nOr am I wrong about something in regards to BTC speed?"}, {"coin": "Litecoin", "sentiment": -0.20000000298023224, "created": 1610188446.0, "text": "I think what people mean about BCH being faster than BTC, is that if you send a 1 cent fee transaction (which used to be the accepted standard on BTC), you will get into a block quickly on BCH and you'll be waiting until the end of time unless you know a charitable miner on BTC.  Thus it is \"faster\" to get confirmations on the BCH blockchain.  Like you say though, this is in some respects really just saying that it's cheaper.  But they are somewhat connected, because if the average user can't afford to pay $10 a transaction every time (and they probably can't) then BCH is effectively a lot faster.\n\nIn addition, BCH users are more likely to accept 0 confirmation transactions, at the time of the split there was huge controversy about whether or not 0 confirmation transactions were acceptable or secure, for BCH the answer was \"we should try and preserve it as a yes\" and the BTC crowd went with \"no\".  And they even made their 0 confirmation transactions LESS reliable with Replace By Fee.  So in this kind of consideration, BCH could be considered \"faster\" in a way because the point at which a merchant will consider the transaction \"secure enough\" is hit quicker.\n\nI suppose there are also outside occurrences where BCH has faster block times than BTC, because it has a more adaptive difficulty adjustment algorithm.  So in scenarios where BTC's hash rate crashed massively just after a difficulty adjustment, there would be slower than 10 minute block times for > 2 weeks.\n\nAs for LTC I don't know, it's probably not faster even with these somewhat obtuse angles of reasoning.  I don't know who is claiming that."}, {"coin": "Bitcoin Cash", "sentiment": 0.10000000149011612, "created": 1610193579.0, "text": "It's faster even with the same 10 min confirmation block times because you can have around 32 times as many transactions within that 10 minutes for Bitcoin Cash compared to BTC. Bitcoin Cash's capacity is also higher than LTC. But Bitcoin Cash is more than just fast cheap and reliable, it also has many unique advantages over the old Bitcoin. Here are the improvements from Bitcoin Cash.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Better Security** \u2013 BTC has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations. This RBF security vulnerability exists only in BTC and not Bitcoin Cash. That's why Bitcoin Cash is more secure as a payment method.\n\nHere is an example of hackers stolen $150000 worth of BTC using the RBF security vulnerability. https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/03/14/double-spenders-scam-150000-bitcoin/\n\nIt is super easy to double spend on Bitcoin using the RBF vulnerability. Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/video-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-double-spend-btc-using-rbf/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Improved Scalability** \u2013 BTC is limited to 1MB block size and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 32x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle PayPal transactions volume today and be global money after a few more upgrades.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Supply Scarcity** \u2013 During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than BTC.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Improved Confirmation Times** \u2013 Due to the limited block size of BTC, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old BTC, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Higher Merchants Adoption** - Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today.

Source: https://np.reddit.com/r/NotAcceptingBitcoin/top/?sort=top&t=all\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Low Fees** \u2013 One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of BTC, fees have exceeded over $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Lightning Network Problems And Vulnerabilities And Loss Funds** - Some people may claim Lightning Network will solve Bitcoin problems but it has failed to gain traction due to many problems and vulnerabilities, such as loss of funds, unreliable transactions (constantly failing), and many other vulnerabilities.\n\nSource: https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/why-does-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-fail-new-study-proves-inefficiency/\n\nSource: https://news.bitcoin.com/researchers-scathing-lightning-network-analysis-finds-flaws/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Tokens** - Bitcoin Cash has tokens to start taking some marketshare from Ethereum. Today, anyone can issue their own loyalty tokens or digital money on Bitcoin Cash from as low as 1 cent to mint it. It's incredibly easy and anyone can do it at https://mint.bitcoin.com/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Better Privacy** - Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle/CashFusion. You can enable it through the setting in the Electron Cash wallet and it's completely optional. If you don't want others to know how you spent your money, it is better to use Bitcoin Cash over BTC.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Better Risk/Reward** - If BTC gains another 500 billion marketcap, it only 2x in price. But that same 500 billion will give you more than 80x your Bitcoin Cash investments. It is such a smarter option given the risk/rewards probabilities.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt the moment, the old BTC has first mover advantage but that can only last them so long.

Bitcoin Cash is what Bitcoin used to be, a low friction limited supply currency which will be the future of money.\n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1. The speed at which your transaction pops up is the speed at which it is broadcast around the network (very fast) rather than the speed that it confirms into the blockchain (takes a little time).  This is the way most cryptocurrencies work, and it's not related to the size of the blockchain.  Bitcoin (Core) takes a long time currently because they have jammed up their entire network and have no plan for undoing that, which was the whole reason Bitcoin Cash split off in the first place.\n2. Electrum doesn't support Bitcoin Cash, but the Bitcoin Cash version is called Electron Cash you can try that.  https://electroncash.org/  Yes, your seed is all you need for a backup and it can be used to recover your coins from any Bitcoin Cash software in the future if you need to do that.  Just be careful with it!\n3. I can't really help you with chart reading, there's a bunch of sites that display good information though and I'm sure you can figure it out yourself. I like https://coin.dance/ quite a lot.\n4. It's fine to use the app because to start I assume you're not putting in tons and tons of money into crypto but as you get more familiar with things or invest more you might want to consider a hardware wallet.\n5. When people here talk about Bitcoin Core they mean the currency labelled \"Bitcoin\" on most websites yes.  If they say \"Bitcoin\" they could mean Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Cash depending on the context.\n6. I imagine those apps you're talking about have a lot of legal regulation that require them to know who you are to send you coins.  Bitcoin (Core or Cash) has no inherent requirement for that, but some services that interact with it do.\n7. That's a matter of opinion and you can make up your own mind.  In my opinion Bitcoin Core is a basically unusable mess with constantly increasing fees and a community focussed on getting rich instead of building a new currency and therefore a speculative bubble.  Following that logic, I prefer buying BCH and don't really bother with BTC any more.  This is just my opinion though, I encourage you to look around for others and make up your own mind.\n8. Again, the fee to buy BCH depends on the service you are using (for instance Coinbase).  When people talk about the fees, they usually mean the fee to send BCH you already own on the network to another BCH address (e.g. using Electron Cash) rather than taking BCH out of an external service which holds the coins on your behalf and which adds its own extra fees (e.g. Coinbase)."}, {"coin": "Bitcoin Cash", "sentiment": -0.6000000238418579, "created": 1610104438.0, "text": "BCH adress invalid??

FYI the bitcoin.com wallet accepts bitcoin (btc) and bitcoin cash (bch).\n\n> What is the quickest way for me to convert these funds to USD in my checking account?\n\nTechnically the quickest way is to use a payment processor which can automatically convert the cryptocurrency into fiat instantly for a small 1% fee or so. This is what most merchants who accept large or frequent amounts of cryptocurrency do. Bitpay is one example, coinpayments.net is another, etc. etc. This service is not possible if you receive payments through the Bitcoin.com wallet. **However**, if you don't expect a lot of customers to pay you in cryptocurrency, then another option is simply to send your BCH after getting paid, to an exchange like Coinbase.com or Kraken.com, and then sell for USD. That is a perfectly acceptable solution as well if you're only getting a few transactions in cryptocurrency every now and then.

Try sending $10 worth of Bitcoin and $10 worth of Bitcoin Cash to yourself and see for yourself the difference. But Bitcoin Cash is more than just fast cheap and reliable, it also has many unique advantages over the old Bitcoin. Here are the improvements from Bitcoin Cash.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Better Security** \u2013 BTC has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations. This RBF security vulnerability exists only in BTC and not Bitcoin Cash. That's why Bitcoin Cash is more secure as a payment method.\n\nHere is an example of hackers stolen $150000 worth of BTC using the RBF security vulnerability. https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/03/14/double-spenders-scam-150000-bitcoin/\n\nIt is super easy to double spend on Bitcoin using the RBF vulnerability. Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/video-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-double-spend-btc-using-rbf/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Improved Scalability** \u2013 BTC is limited to 1MB block size and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 32x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle PayPal transactions volume today and be global money after a few more upgrades.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Supply Scarcity** \u2013 During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than BTC.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Improved Confirmation Times** \u2013 Due to the limited block size of BTC, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old BTC, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Higher Merchants Adoption** - Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today.

Source: https://np.reddit.com/r/NotAcceptingBitcoin/top/?sort=top&t=all\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Low Fees** \u2013 One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of BTC, fees have exceeded over $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Lightning Network Problems And Vulnerabilities And Loss Funds** - Some people may claim Lightning Network will solve Bitcoin problems but it has failed to gain traction due to many problems and vulnerabilities, such as loss of funds, unreliable transactions (constantly failing), and many other vulnerabilities.\n\nSource: https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/why-does-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-fail-new-study-proves-inefficiency/\n\nSource: https://news.bitcoin.com/researchers-scathing-lightning-network-analysis-finds-flaws/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Tokens** - Bitcoin Cash has tokens to start taking some marketshare from Ethereum. Today, anyone can issue their own loyalty tokens or digital money on Bitcoin Cash from as low as 1 cent to mint it. It's incredibly easy and anyone can do it at https://mint.bitcoin.com/\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Better Privacy** - Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle/CashFusion. You can enable it through the setting in the Electron Cash wallet and it's completely optional. If you don't want others to know how you spent your money, it is better to use Bitcoin Cash over BTC.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Better Risk/Reward** - If BTC gains another 500 billion marketcap, it only 2x in price. But that same 500 billion will give you more than 80x your Bitcoin Cash investments. It is such a smarter option given the risk/rewards probabilities.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt the moment, the old BTC has first mover advantage but that can only last them so long.

I don\u2019t care about inflation, one billion trillion coins in circulation, market cap being more than the entire globe, lil yachti, fundamentals, worldwide use, Bitcoin patterns, dump and pumps, your opinion. \n\nWhy don\u2019t I care? Because Dogecoin is truly unique, it is it\u2019s own species of cryptocurrency, and we don\u2019t understand it and that\u2019s okay.\n\nMemes play a role in shaping culture of society. Currently we understand memes as images on our screens that we relate to. If this is the case then memes have existed in the past and will clearly evolve into the future. \n\nDogecoin is the product of the economy and memes colliding into one, it is beyond our current comprehension. It isn\u2019t investing into cloud computing, artificial intelligence, electric vehicles, rather it is investing into the very economic system in which all transactions will occur. \n\nOne day we will understand, maybe tomorrow, maybe EOY 2021, 2022, 2023, 10 years from now, 20 years. \n\nYou might think, \u201cit\u2019s a joke, a dog coin\u201d and in your head you think about how ridiculous exchanges would be using a worthless coin with the portrait of a shiba inu. How can you buy a house? A car? Your future? With a funny looking coin? A joke? \n\nIt is ridiculous, I can totally understand. At least right now, in our current paradigm. \n\nBut notice how we use dollars. An example: A one dollar bill with the \u201call seeing eye pyramid\u201d and \u201cnew world order\u201d written across it with all seriousness. It is a symbol, and symbols change over time. They change so much that after some time it loses it\u2019s meaning and becomes the norm. \n\nIn the future people may use Dogecoin without even thinking twice. Day to day, normal use. An image of a doge, loyal and noble. Much like we use dollars with images of significant historical people.\n\nDon\u2019t you think people thought it was strange using little symbols and pictures at first? And yet now we accept it, and sacrifice our lives for it?\n\nAll you have to do now and can do now is HODL, HODL and it will pay off. Do it for you, your family, your children, your children\u2019s children. Just HODL.\n\nThis is the future.

People started to use it as an exchange medium not for value or gain but for things, then people started to use it to give to others to show appreciation for assorted things. Doge had merchants by day two which in the scope of everything that exists in cryptocurrency is a bit abnormal. It did create a foundation for commerce which at this point Doge is one of the most accepted cryptocurrencies that exist, placing top 10 in many and top 20 in most for usage. The engagement level here is not 1.50$ for something like a game key but 151.5358811 Doge (rounded up typically) to 153 or 160 Doge.\n\n[Cryptwerk](https://cryptwerk.com/analytics/) is one of the only ones putting analytics public facing, they have 25 different assets engaged; Doge sits 7th. ^(Real talk, one day I do hope that all of the different merchant platforms are putting figures frontal. The backside data to things is amazing in a way that many people would not expect.)\n\nThe notation also has roots to at the end of it all a Dogecoin is simply a Dogecoin, there is 0 inherent value tied to things. If you have 5 Doge then you have 5 Doge not  0.00000127 BTC or 0.04949341 USD. Price and value are external to everything as that is dictated by third party engagements, Dogecoins can/are still gotten for just mining cost power.\n\n>I see this also referenced with people being upset about others looking for an opportunity to make a profit. \n\nWhen it is done here, it is less directly about making a profit and more the manner in which the discussion around it is happening. This place has rules, the rules have not changed and they are by communal dictation. Price posts, speculation..Have never been allowed [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/wiki/dogecoinrules) The price ticker in the sidebar is also tagged to Dogecoin price ticker: \u01101 = \u01101.\n\n>If you're not investing ultimately looking for a larger payout,\n\nDogecoin is not an [investment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/hnm8hr/raid_raid_raid/fxcczt8/)\n\n>what's the reason to invest in the first place?\n\nThere are no [investors.](https://old.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/9pqox7/when_will_doge_moon/e84jpu8/)\n\n>I've seen people say they are doing it in order to purchase other stocks, but is that not the same concept? \n\nMany of the people posting here, have never been to the subreddit before the past few days. This is not to say that they are not allowed, but the perception of things in relation to the current content vs the normal content here is skewed heavily. It happens whenever there is something going on elsewhere, [stats](https://subredditstats.com/r/dogecoin) can be put against a market chart with fun similarities. Those sharp jumps and drastic drop offs, those are moments like current where things get a massive flood of interest that lingers for a short while then poofs. Not saying that it is bad, just that during these times it is not an actual reflection of the community here. \n\n>Seriously confused when I see people say 1 doge = 1 doge and get upset when people talk about making a cash profit.\n\nIt is a very hard line to walk between the existing community and dealing with the influx of people who from a community standpoint are valid, they have the rights to engage, they are welcomed and in turn having awareness for just what this place is along with respecting that. This is all something shiny, new, exciting for people yet it is getting lost that in the scope of it all many people are sort of just rushing threw with bats instead of wiping their feet at the door. Which is something that has ongoing been a struggle as every time that little chart there goes swoosh in turn many of the natives here just hide elsewhere and wait it out, or their time is spent attempting to engage with new people and being rebuffed real hard for trying to help answer or note things. \n\nSpeculation makes up about 25% of the usage for Dogecoin while it is less than the primary usage, there is still acknowledgement that they are users too. Dogecoin users come from many different interests, my only thing in this all is that I wish people would take the time to learn about what exactly it is that they are playing with. Market people get wiped out being too focused on micro level while macro comes and just sweeps them off into the red sea. Users who engage in functional ways are really bad at times in relation to holding their own assets; so they lose them often in trading ease for security. Service providers while doing amazing things, can do incredibly stupid things like failing to make backups or derping servers into the void. Learning, being aware, having awareness. This would be my only criticism but it is not specific to any side of the fences.\n\nThis is a bit much to read, the issue under it is sort of complicated while not being specific to just this place. There is validity to the annoyance that people can have in the same this is a place for everyone. Personally I move between them all, I hate to discuss economics yet find myself having to do that more and more in an effort to actually explain to people here *what* is actually going on. I do not care why they are here as when they are here they are shibes, much like puppies sometimes accidents happen and one poos on the floor..

The battle between VHS format and Beta max was real. Betamax was the upshot format and had few followers, but was indeed the better format. But what happened is legendary, like the battle for dominance in AC vs DC (ie Tesla vs Edison) the less effective and efficient system won. In the battle over VHS & Beta , VHS was more widely adopted by the porn industry and this became the dominant video format. My suggestion might be to encourage the adult entertainment industry to allow Doge become a viable standard for the consumption of online purchases.
